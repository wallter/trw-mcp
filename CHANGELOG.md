# Changelog

All notable changes to the TRW MCP server package.

## [0.46.0] — 2026-04-18

### Changed

- **Renamed MCP tool `trw_claude_md_sync` → `trw_instructions_sync`.** The
  tool writes the appropriate client instruction surface for whichever IDE
  is configured (`CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `AGENTS.md` for opencode /
  Codex, `.codex/INSTRUCTIONS.md` for Codex-CLI, etc.) — it is not
  CLAUDE.md-specific. The old name is retained as a deprecated alias that
  emits a `logger.warning` on call and will be removed in a future
  release. Docs, skills, agents, bundled client templates, and behavioral
  protocol directives all use the canonical name.

### Deprecated

- **`trw_claude_md_sync`** — callers should migrate to
  `trw_instructions_sync`. The alias is still registered for backward
  compatibility but logs a deprecation warning on every invocation and
  will be removed in a future release.

### Migration

- If your agent config, skill, or CI script calls `trw_claude_md_sync`,
  replace it with `trw_instructions_sync`. Behavior is unchanged; only
  the tool name differs.

## [0.45.2] — 2026-04-17

### Changed

- **Tightened trw-memory pin to `>=0.6.10,<1.0.0`** — v0.45.1 pinned `>=0.6.9` but v0.6.9 never published to PyPI (smoke-test-gated release caught a latent bug where `import trw_memory` failed on a bare install without httpx). v0.6.10 ships the sqlite-vec AttributeError fix (original intent of v0.6.9) + the httpx base-dep fix. No code changes in this bump; pin tightening only.

## [0.45.1] — 2026-04-17

### Fixed

- **Fresh macOS installs no longer surface "sqlite extension error in the MCP server" at every `trw_learn` call** — on macOS system Python and some python.org builds, `sqlite3` is compiled without `SQLITE_ENABLE_LOAD_EXTENSION`, so `conn.enable_load_extension(True)` in `MemoryStore.__init__` raised `AttributeError` (method absent) or `OperationalError` (not authorized), propagating up through the MCP server. Added try/except around the extension-load block in `trw_mcp/state/memory_store.py`: on failure the connection is closed and `self._conn` stays `None`, matching the existing docstring contract ("all operations are no-ops and available() returns False — the retrieval engine falls back to BM25-only"). A `memory_store_extension_unavailable` warning is emitted with the exception type + detail + remediation hint. Added two regression tests (`TestExtensionLoadFailureDegradesGracefully`) covering both exception types via a sqlite3 connection proxy. Requires `trw-memory>=0.6.9`, which carries the paired fix in `SQLiteBackend.__init__`.

### Added

- **2026-04-16 — Nudge telemetry now emits a `nudge_shown` event per impression** (PRD-QUAL-058-FR04). `record_nudge_shown()` in `_ceremony_progress_state.py` continues to update `ceremony-state.json` as before, but now also appends a discrete `{"event":"nudge_shown","learning_id":...,"phase":...,"data":{...}}` record to `.trw/context/session-events.jsonl`. This unblocks the trw-eval pipeline's event-based ceremony scoring path — previously ceremony scores for trw-full runs floored at 25/100 because only `session_start` detected via regex fallback. Emission is fail-open: the primary state update is never blocked by a session-event append failure. Event schema carries both top-level `learning_id`/`phase` (for the FR06 pre-analyzer JSONL matcher) and a nested `data` payload with `turn` + `surface_type` for downstream consumers (`proximal_reward.py`, `TraceAnalyzer`). A new `surface_type: str = "nudge"` keyword arg lets callers distinguish `phase_transition` vs `nudge` impressions. All existing positional callers are unaffected. Version bumped 0.44.7 → 0.45.0 (minor — additive feature).

- **2026-04-13 — Per-connection run isolation is stronger** (PRD-CORE-141) — parallel clients sharing one repo are less likely to step on each other's active run, which makes session state, logging, and follow-up tool calls more trustworthy.

### Changed

- **2026-04-13 — PRD guidance is more truthful** — lifecycle guidance and validation now better reflect the workflows the tools actually support, including eval-oriented PRDs, which reduces doc-vs-runtime drift.

### Fixed

- **2026-04-13 — Instruction and inventory drift was tightened further** — tool manifest descriptions and related inventory/docs were reconciled so generated guidance is less likely to describe the wrong surface area.
- **2026-04-15 — Installer no longer crashes on renamed/legacy IDE identifiers in prior `.trw/config.yaml`** — when `cursor` was split into `cursor-ide` + `cursor-cli` in v0.44, upgrade runs of `install-trw.py` tripped `_normalize_ide_targets` and died with a raw `ValueError` traceback at preflight (reported from a v0.44.3 reinstall). `_LEGACY_IDE_ALIASES` now migrates `cursor` → `cursor-ide` silently; unknown identifiers in prior config emit an orange warning (`ui.warn`) naming the offenders plus the supported set and the installer proceeds with the valid entries. Typos in the `--ide` CLI flag get a `difflib`-powered "did you mean '<nearest>'?" hint instead of a plain enumeration. Applied to `trw-mcp/scripts/install-trw.template.py`, the repo-root `install-trw.py`, and `trw-mcp/dist/install-trw.py`. Verified with a five-case smoke test covering legacy alias, mixed alias+unknown, all-unknown, missing-ui path, and strict-mode typo suggestion.

## [0.44.5] — 2026-04-13

### Fixed

- **`trw_status` / `trw_session_start` disagreement on current run** (PRD-FIX-077, reported from cursor-ide usage). `resolve_run_path` ignored the per-session pin set by `trw_init` / `trw_session_start`, instead picking the run with the latest `run.yaml` mtime — which could be a completed or abandoned run whose `summary.yaml` had just been written by another process. Users saw `trw_session_start` return run A and `trw_status` return a different run B in the same MCP session. Fix: `resolve_run_path` now delegates auto-detection to `find_active_run()` first (which honors the session pin + status-aware filter), and falls back to `_find_latest_run_dir` only when no pinned or active run exists. Affects all callers of `resolve_run_path(None)` — `trw_status`, `trw_checkpoint`, `trw_run_report`, the shared `orchestration_service`, and `TRWConfig` run-path resolution. New `resolve_run_path_mtime_fallback` structlog event surfaces when the fallback path is taken.
- **Doc inconsistency: `trw-release` listed as a Cursor IDE mirrored skill** but `_IDE_CURATED_SKILLS` omits it (no bundled `data/skills/trw-release/` directory yet). Removed from `docs/CLIENT-PROFILES.md` Cursor IDE skills list; added a one-line note pointing to the `/trw-release` slash command path with a follow-up PRD reference.
- **Doc nuance: "18-event hook system"** (two occurrences in CLIENT-PROFILES.md) now reads "hook system (Cursor exposes 18 agent events + 2 tab events; TRW wires a curated 8-event subset)" — prevents readers from expecting 18 TRW-provided handlers.

### Added

- **7 new tests** in `tests/test_resolve_run_path_alignment.py` covering the pin-wins-over-mtime contract, active-run filter precedence, explicit-path precedence, mtime fallback preservation, end-to-end `trw_status == trw_session_start` alignment, and structured log emission.

## [0.44.4] — 2026-04-13

### Added

- **Anti-fatigue nudge gate for Cursor hooks** — new `_nudge_gate.py` bundled helper applies three levers before any user-visible hook response (`followup_message` / `additional_context` / `user_message`):
  1. **Cooldown dedup** via `.trw/logs/cursor-nudge-state.jsonl` — per `(event, conversation_id|generation_id)`, re-fires within the cooldown window return `{}`. Defaults: stop=1h, sessionStart=24h, preCompact=5min (keyed on generation_id for finer granularity).
  2. **Adaptive skip** — scans `cursor-hooks.jsonl` for the ceremony tool the nudge would prompt for. If invoked in the last 30 min, suppresses the nudge (the agent is already doing what we'd remind them to do).
  3. **Message rotation** — stable per-conversation selection from a curated 3-message set via `sha256(conversation_id) % len(messages)`. Different conversations rotate through the full population; same conversation always sees the same message.

- **25 new tests** in `tests/test_cursor_hook_nudge_gate.py` covering cooldown dedup (4), adaptive skip (4), message rotation (2), response-key parametrization (4), generation-id dedup for preCompact (2), fail-open paths (3), end-to-end bash hook pipeline (6).

### Fixed

- **Cursor IDE nudge spam** — prior behavior: `trw-stop.sh`, `trw-session-start.sh`, and `trw-pre-compact.sh` emitted their user-visible message on every hook fire. Reported in a real session: the deliver reminder displayed 4+ times because the stop hook fires per-turn in long sessions, not just at session end (cursor-hooks.jsonl showed 15 stop events in one session, each popping a sticky notification). All three scripts now compose the new gate and default to `{}` when the gate suppresses. Observability remains: every fire is logged to `cursor-hooks.jsonl` unconditionally.

### Changed

- `trw-stop.sh`, `trw-session-start.sh`, `trw-pre-compact.sh` refactored to wrap the gate. Each script: (a) tees stdin via mktemp (avoids argv-size limits on long conversations), (b) logs the fire to `cursor-hooks.jsonl`, (c) invokes `_nudge_gate.py` with per-hook cooldown / adaptive-skip-tool / curated messages array. Backward compatible at the Cursor-hook contract level.

## [0.44.3] — 2026-04-13

### Fixed

- **PyPI release workflow broken by committed `dist/install-trw.py`**. The self-contained installer script had been accidentally committed to `trw-mcp/dist/install-trw.py` (the path is gitignored at the repo root, but the file was added before the ignore rule landed). When `python -m build` ran in CI, it added the wheel + sdist alongside the already-present `install-trw.py`, causing `twine` to reject the upload with `InvalidDistribution: Unknown distribution format: 'install-trw.py'`. Release v0.44.2 to PyPI failed for this reason. Untracked the file via `git rm --cached` — the gitignore rule continues to prevent it from being re-added. Local installer builds still produce it (as intended) — the script is generated fresh per release by `scripts/build_installer.py`.

## [0.44.2] — 2026-04-13

### Fixed

- **`.mcp.json` user-customized `trw` entry is now preserved** during `update-project`. Companion bug to PRD-FIX-076 (target_platforms narrowing): the merge logic in `_merge_mcp_json` unconditionally overwrote the existing `trw` server entry, destroying the dev-repo pattern where `command` is pinned to an absolute venv binary path (e.g. `/repo/trw-mcp/.venv/bin/trw-mcp`).
  - New `_is_user_customized_trw_entry()` heuristic: an entry is preserved when its `command` is an absolute path to an extant file, OR when it has fields beyond `{command, args}` (e.g. `env`, `cwd`).
  - Default-shape entries (bare `trw-mcp` + just `args=["--debug"]`) are still safe to refresh.
  - Conservative heuristic: when in doubt, prefer preservation over rewrite.
- **`.mcp.json` preservation classification fix**: when preserving, the result is appended to `result["preserved"]` (not `result["updated"]` via the legacy `_result_action_key` fallback), so dispatcher counts are accurate.
- **TestIDEDetection environment isolation**: 8 stale tests that broke after Wave 1's `shutil.which("cursor")` + `shutil.which("cursor-agent")` additions now run deterministically via a new autouse fixture that monkey-patches `shutil.which` to filter cursor binaries and deletes `CURSOR_*` env vars, isolating `tmp_path` tests from the developer's installed IDEs.
- **TestIdempotency::test_second_run_skips_existing**: `expected_always_write` set extended with cursor-managed templates added in Sprint 91 (subagents, commands, skills mirror, rules MDC, hooks scripts) — these are intentionally re-rendered on every init for idempotency.

### Added

- **Structured logging** for the .mcp.json merge path:
  - `mcp_config_preserved` (info) when a user-customized entry is preserved, with `existing_command` field for debugging
  - `mcp_config_updated` (info) with `reason="default_entry_refreshed"` or `reason="entry_added"` distinguishing refresh vs first-add
- **13 new tests** in `tests/test_mcp_json_preservation.py` covering: absolute-path-to-existing-file detection, absolute-path-to-missing-file rejection, bare-command detection, python-module-invocation detection, extra-keys detection, list-command form, defensive non-dict input, dev-repo abs path preservation, user env-field preservation, other-servers untouched, default-entry refreshable, missing-file creates default, structured log emission.

## [0.44.1] — 2026-04-13

### Fixed

- **`update-project --ide <name>` no longer narrows `target_platforms`** in `.trw/config.yaml`. Prior behavior unconditionally replaced the user's full multi-platform list with a single-element list containing only the override IDE — destroying multi-platform dev configurations the moment a user ran a focused install. The new contract is **augmentation, never narrowing**:
  - Existing entries are preserved.
  - New `--ide <name>` targets are appended in original order.
  - Duplicates are deduplicated (first occurrence wins).
  - When the merge is a no-op, the file is preserved (not rewritten).
  - All other config fields (`mcp_*`, `installation_id`, `embeddings_*`, `platform_*`, etc.) are preserved.
- **Legacy `cursor` profile identifier silently migrated to `cursor-ide`** during config refresh. Sprint 91 (PRD-CORE-136 / PRD-CORE-137) split `cursor` into `cursor-ide` + `cursor-cli` and removed the bare identifier; users upgrading from pre-0.44 versions had `target_platforms: [..., cursor, ...]` in their config that would fall through to the unknown-ID warning + claude-code fallback. The new `_LEGACY_PROFILE_RENAMES` table in `bootstrap/_ide_targets.py` migrates the entry on the next `update-project` call.
- **Error handling narrowed** in `_update_config_target_platforms`: catches `(OSError, yaml.YAMLError)` explicitly instead of broad `Exception`. Warning string includes exception class name for debugging.

### Added

- **Structured logging** for the augmentation path:
  - `config_target_platforms_augmented` (info) on successful merge with `previous` / `current` / `added` / `requested` fields
  - `config_target_platforms_unchanged` (debug) when the merge is a no-op
  - `config_target_platforms_update_failed` (warning) on YAML / I/O error with `error_class` + `error` fields
- **13 new tests** in `tests/test_target_platforms_augmentation.py` covering: single-IDE override does not narrow, original ordering preserved, new IDE appended, multiple new IDEs in order, legacy `cursor` migration, dedupe when both old + new exist, other config fields preserved, existing duplicates collapsed, no-op detection, missing-config silent return, malformed YAML warning, augmentation log emission, unchanged log emission.

## [0.44.0] — 2026-04-13

### Breaking Changes
- **`cursor` client profile split into `cursor-ide` + `cursor-cli`** (PRD-CORE-136, PRD-CORE-137). The bare `cursor` identifier is no longer registered — users running `target_platforms: [cursor]` must migrate to `[cursor-ide]` (the GUI IDE) or `[cursor-cli]` (the `cursor-agent` headless tool), or both for dual-surface development. The unknown-ID fallback log names both replacement identifiers explicitly for CI log-scraping detection. No deprecation alias is retained.

### Added
- **Cursor IDE full-ceremony profile** (PRD-CORE-136, `cursor-ide`) — Claude-Code-equivalent calibration (25/25/15/10/10/15) with native Cursor 2.4+ surface coverage: subagents (`.cursor/agents/trw-*.md`), Agent Skills (`.cursor/skills/`, agentskills.io-compliant), slash commands (`.cursor/commands/trw-*.md`), 8-event hook expansion with bash adapter scripts emitting JSON stdout.
- **Cursor CLI light-ceremony profile** (PRD-CORE-137, `cursor-cli`) — headless/CI calibration (30/30/10/20/10/0) with `AGENTS.md` as primary write target, `.cursor/cli.json` permissions baseline, 5-event CLI-safe hook subset (`beforeShellExecution` + `beforeMCPExecution` with `failClosed: true`), bootstrap summary reminder about TTY requirement + tmux workaround.
- **Shared Cursor bootstrap core** (`bootstrap/_cursor.py`) — seven named exports composed by both surface-specific modules: `_get_trw_mcp_entry_cursor`, `generate_cursor_mcp_config`, `generate_cursor_rules_mdc` (with `client_id` param), `generate_cursor_skills_mirror`, `generate_cursor_hook_scripts`, `build_cursor_hook_config`, `smart_merge_cursor_json`. DRY-enforced via `trw-dry-check` + code-review gate.
- **WriteTargets field additions**: `agents_md_primary` (CLI profiles that treat AGENTS.md as primary) and `cli_config` (CLI profiles with a managed `.cursor/cli.json`).
- **Detection update**: `_utils.py::detect_ide` distinguishes cursor-ide (`.cursor/` dir, `CURSOR_TRACE_ID`, `cursor` binary) from cursor-cli (`.cursor/cli.json`, `cursor-agent` binary without `CURSOR_TRACE_ID`, `CURSOR_API_KEY`). Both can be detected simultaneously; `source_detection.py::_PROVIDER_ENV_MAP` updated to emit `cursor-ide`.

### Changed
- Eight profiles: `claude-code`, `opencode`, `cursor-ide`, `cursor-cli`, `codex`, `copilot`, `gemini`, `aider`. `SUPPORTED_IDES` list updated accordingly.
- `docs/CLIENT-PROFILES.md` adds dedicated "Cursor IDE Support Surface" and "Cursor CLI Support Surface" sections documenting profile config, managed artifacts, hook event coverage, permissions schema, detection rules, TTY gotcha + tmux workaround, and current Cursor references.

## [0.43.0] — 2026-04-13

### Breaking Changes
- **Tool surface reduced from 25 to 14 tools** (PRD-FIX-075, PRD-FIX-076). Removed: `trw_prd_draft_frs`, `trw_run_report`, `trw_usage_report`, `trw_analytics_report`, `trw_quality_dashboard`, `trw_ceremony_status`, `trw_ceremony_approve`, `trw_ceremony_revert`, `trw_trust_level`, `trw_progressive_expand`, `trw_knowledge_sync`, `trw_preflight_log`. Underlying business logic modules retained as internal APIs.

### Added
- **ProtocolRenderer** — unified instruction generation for all platforms (PRD-CORE-131)
- **Local ceremony fallback** — `trw-mcp local init/checkpoint` CLI subcommands work without MCP server (PRD-FIX-073)
- **Analytics turn-scoped cache** — ContextVar-based cache with 5s TTL eliminates redundant YAML reads (PRD-FIX-072)
- **Gemini absolute path resolution** — `shutil.which` for reliable `trw-mcp` command resolution (PRD-FIX-072)
- **Shared service layer** — `trw_mcp.services.orchestration_service` for DRY run scaffolding (PRD-FIX-073)

### Changed
- Tool presets: `all`=14, `standard`=12, `minimal`=6, `core`=4
- Framework version: v24.5_TRW → v24.6_TRW
- `email-template` skill renamed from `trw-email-template` (local-only, not published)
- PRD-CORE-133 deprecated (LLMs handle research-to-FR drafting natively)

## [0.42.0] — 2026-04-12

### Added

- **Instruction-tool manifest sync (PRD-CORE-135)** — ensures instruction files only describe tools actually exposed in the current `ClientProfile`, preventing agents from entering infinite retry loops calling ghost tools
  - `TOOL_DESCRIPTIONS` canonical mapping of all 25 `trw_*` tools with compile-time assertion against `TOOL_PRESETS`
  - `render_tool_list()` conditionally renders tool descriptions filtered by `exposed_tools` set
  - `validate_instruction_manifest()` finds `trw_*` tool mentions not in the exposed set (ignores non-tool `trw_` identifiers like `trw_dir`)
  - `check_instruction_tool_parity()` delivery gate R-08 — soft warning when AGENTS.md mentions unexposed tools
  - `trw-mcp check-instructions` CLI command — scans AGENTS.md/CLAUDE.md, exits 1 on mismatches
  - `ToolEntry` NamedTuple for structured tool iteration
  - `resolve_exposed_tools()` returns `frozenset[str]` for immutability
  - `_check_instructions_core()` extracted for testability without `sys.exit()`
  - 47 tests covering all 3 FRs with parametrized edge cases

### Fixed

- **AGENTS.md always rendered all tools regardless of exposure mode** — `render_agents_trw_section()` and `render_codex_trw_section()` accepted an `exposed_tools` parameter but it was never passed from the AGENTS.md sync call chain. Now wired through `_sync_agents_md_if_needed()`.
- **`UnicodeDecodeError` handling** — instruction file reading now catches encoding errors alongside `OSError` (fail-open)

## [0.41.2] — 2026-04-12

### Fixed

- **Runaway memory consolidation** (PRD-FIX-071) — tag-overlap clustering fallback created super-clusters of 900+ entries via transitive union-find, producing entries with 1500+ tags and recurrence 950,000+ that poisoned all recall queries
  - `max_cluster_size` cap (default 10) prevents super-clusters in union-find
  - `max_consolidated_tags` cap (default 20) keeps top-N tags by cluster frequency
  - Cluster size sanity check in `consolidate_cycle` skips oversized clusters
  - Tag cap on `merge_entries` prevents unbounded growth during dedup merges
  - `min_shared_tags` increased from 2 to 3 in tag-overlap fallback
  - Recurrence now uses `len(cluster)` instead of exponentially-compounding `sum()`
  - New `TRWConfig` fields: `max_cluster_size`, `max_consolidated_tags`
- **Recall returns obsolete entries** — `trw_recall` now defaults to `status="active"`, excluding obsolete/corrupted entries from results

## [0.41.1] — 2026-04-12

### Added

- **Google Gemini CLI integration** — 7th client profile with full-ceremony support
  - `gemini` ClientProfile: 1M token context, hooks/skills/delegation enabled, Agent Teams disabled (uses native `.gemini/agents/` subagents)
  - `WriteTargets.gemini_md` boolean field for GEMINI.md instruction sync
  - `bootstrap/_gemini.py` — 3 public functions: `generate_gemini_instructions()`, `generate_gemini_mcp_config()`, `generate_gemini_agents()`
  - `GEMINI.md` smart-merge with `<!-- trw:gemini:start/end -->` markers
  - `.gemini/settings.json` MCP deep-merge (only touches `mcpServers.trw`, preserves all other settings)
  - `.gemini/agents/trw-{explorer,implementer,reviewer,lead}.md` subagent definitions with Gemini-native tool names (`grep_search`, `read_file`, `replace`, etc.)
  - IDE detection via `.gemini/` directory or `GEMINI.md` file
  - CLI `--ide gemini` support for `init-project` and `update-project`
  - 73 tests across 10 test classes (profile, detection, instructions, smart-merge, MCP config, agents, init, update, wiring)
  - Dev repo uses shared HTTP MCP (`httpUrl: http://127.0.0.1:8100/mcp`); installer generates standard stdio for user projects
  - Comprehensive research at `docs/research/providers/gemini/` (3 documents, 2000+ lines)

### Changed

- CLI `--ide` choices expanded from 5 to 7 (added `copilot`, `gemini`, `aider`) for both `init-project` and `update-project` commands
- `SUPPORTED_IDES` constant includes `gemini`
- `InstructionClientId` type includes `"gemini"`
- Module docstring updated: "Seven profiles" (was "Six profiles")

## [0.41.1] — 2026-04-11

### Added

- **PRD integrity validation (PRD-QUAL-060)** — `trw_prd_validate()` / V2 PRD validation now run repo-aware integrity checks for unsupported PRD categories, broken repo-path citations, and likely duplicate PRD candidates. Integrity failures are emitted in the validation result and duplicate candidates surface as `integrity_warnings`.
- **Research provenance lint helper** — `state/validation/research_provenance.py` adds an opt-in markdown lint for quantitative/speculative claims and generated-artifact source-of-truth references. Initial coverage locks in the OpenCode research docs that triggered the drift audit.

### Changed

- **OpenCode instruction rendering unified** — `render_opencode_instructions()` now delegates to the shared `_opencode_sections.py` renderer so the OpenCode profile has a single instruction source of truth.
- **OpenCode/Codex bootstrap lifecycle aligned with documented contract** — init-project now creates `AGENTS.md` for both IDEs, update-project passes managed-artifact hashes into both instruction generators, and instruction generation reports `created` vs `updated` based on pre-write file existence instead of post-write checks.
- **Client profile docs corrected** — `docs/CLIENT-PROFILES.md` now documents OpenCode/Codex instruction preservation and shared `AGENTS.md` behavior as a contract surface.
- **Historical OpenCode research notes corrected** — the 2026-04-10 OpenCode research docs now carry provenance-tagged executive summaries that distinguish repo-verified findings from hypotheses and identify `Makefile`, `build_installer.py`, and `install-trw.template.py` as the installer source of truth.

### Fixed

- **User-edited instruction files are preserved on update** — `.trw/managed-artifacts.yaml` now records content hashes for `.opencode/INSTRUCTIONS.md`, `.codex/INSTRUCTIONS.md`, and shared `AGENTS.md`, which allows update flows to preserve customized instruction files instead of overwriting them.
- **OpenCode/Codex contract regressions covered** — focused bootstrap, client-profile, and per-client-instructions tests now lock in AGENTS creation, instruction preservation, and the corrected renderer/output behavior.

## [0.41.0] — 2026-04-11

### Added

- **Implementation-readiness scoring dimension (PRD-QUAL-059)** — 4th active scoring dimension evaluates whether PRDs contain actionable proof of implementation: control points, behavior switch matrices, key files, test subsections, completion evidence. Variant-aware: feature PRDs reward different subsections than fix or research PRDs.
- **`score_implementation_readiness()` function** in `_prd_scoring.py` — ~150 lines of variant-aware scoring logic with pre-computed subheading extraction for performance.
- **`validation_implementation_readiness_weight` config field** — default weight 25.0, exposed in `_fields_ceremony.py`.
- **Risk profile 4-tuple weights** — `RiskProfile` now carries `(density, structure, readiness, traceability)` weights that always sum to 100. All 4 risk levels updated.
- **Anti-Goodhart regression tests** in `test_prd_quality_flywheel.py` — proof-rich PRDs outscore padding-rich ones; suggestion ordering deprioritizes density.
- **EVAL template variant** mapped to `feature` scoring in `template_variants.py`.

### Changed

- **PRD validation rebalanced to 4 dimensions** — weights shifted from `(25/25/50)` to `(20/20/25/35)` for medium-risk default. Suggestion priority order: `implementation_readiness` → `traceability` → `structural_completeness` → `content_density`.
- **Groom skill updated** (`trw-prd-groom/SKILL.md`) — readiness-first guidance replaces density-first approach.
- **Review skill updated** (`trw-prd-review/SKILL.md`) — proof-oriented review criteria added.
- **Config reference updated** (`data/config_reference.md`) — documents new weight field and 4-dimension model.

### Fixed

- **FR-count inflation bug** — `_count_planned_requirements()` now counts actual FR sections first, falls back to unique FR refs when absent. Always returns ≥1 (division-by-zero safe). Previously raw `FR\d+` regex matches over-counted repeated refs in traceability matrices.
- **DRY: pre-compute `_extract_subheadings()`** — was called 12+ times per `score_implementation_readiness()` invocation (once per `_has_named_subheading()` call). Now extracted once at function entry.
- **DRY: pre-compute `_extract_fr_sections()`** — was called twice in `score_traceability_v2()`. Now extracted once.
- **AI operational ratio cap** — ratio could exceed 1.0 due to keyword/section count mismatch (10 keywords vs 7 expected sections). Capped at 1.0.
- **DRY: shared feature/infrastructure subsection lists** — deduplicated identical lists across readiness and structure scorers.
- **`CeremonyFeedbackStatus` literal** — fixed type annotation in `_ceremony.py` TypedDict.
- **Redundant `str()` casts** removed in `ceremony.py` and `learning.py`.

- **GitHub Copilot CLI integration (PRD-CORE-127)**
  - `copilot` ClientProfile with 200k context, hooks/skills/agent-teams enabled
  - `WriteTargets.copilot_instructions` boolean field for Copilot instruction sync
  - `bootstrap/_copilot.py` — 5 public functions for Copilot artifact generation
  - 6 Copilot-format agents in `data/copilot/agents/*.agent.md`
  - 10 bundled skills in `data/copilot/skills/*/SKILL.md`
  - `data/copilot/hooks/hooks.json` — v1 format hook templates
  - `data/copilot/plugin.json` — plugin manifest for `copilot plugin install`
  - Plugin distribution: `data/copilot/plugin/` with agents, skills, hooks, MCP config
  - Copilot detection in `_utils.py` (`detect_ide`, `detect_installed_clis`, `SUPPORTED_IDES`)
  - `_update_copilot_artifacts()` in `_ide_targets.py` for update pipeline
  - 80 copilot-specific tests in `tests/test_copilot.py`

- **DRY bootstrap helpers**
  - `_new_result()` and `_record_write()` extracted to `_file_ops.py`
  - `_absorb_sub_result()` in `_ide_targets.py` replaces repetitive extend patterns
  - `_codex.py` and `_opencode.py` refactored to use shared helpers

### Changed

- **Codex runtime alignment (PRD-CORE-128)**
  - Codex guidance, sync, and bootstrap now follow the declared light-profile contract instead of separate hardcoded assumptions.
  - `.codex/INSTRUCTIONS.md` is wired through `model_instructions_file`, and Codex instruction sync now reports instruction-file results consistently.
  - Codex-facing instructions no longer claim a fixed 200K context window, mandatory framework reading, universal hook coverage, or implicit background delegation.
  - `_codex.py` now defaults `features.codex_hooks` to `false`, only generates `.codex/hooks.json` when the repo explicitly opts in, and preserves user-edited `.codex/agents/*.toml` plus `.agents/skills/*` helper artifacts unless regeneration is forced.
  - Codex docs now explicitly distinguish the profile-layer `skills_enabled = false` flag from installer-managed helper skill directories referenced via `skills.config`.

### Fixed

- **Codex stdio MCP startup**
  - `server/_tools.py` now uses FastMCP's public `list_tools()` API instead of the broken `_tool_manager` internal, eliminating startup-time tool exposure filter failures on newer FastMCP builds.
  - `server/__init__.py` now configures a quiet stderr-only logger before eager registration, preventing import-time warnings from polluting stdout and breaking stdio JSON-RPC clients such as Codex.
- `result["warnings"]` KeyError in `_init_project.py` and `_ide_targets.py` — replaced with `setdefault()`
- mypy `BootstrapFileResult` type mismatch in `_codex.py` — added `cast()` for dict→TypedDict

## [0.40.0] - 2026-04-07

  - `sync/pull.py` — conditional GET with ETag support
  - `sync/cache.py` — local intelligence cache with atomic writes and TTL
  - `sync/client.py` — BackendSyncClient orchestrating bidirectional push+pull
  - `_fields_sync.py` config mixin — backend_url, sync_interval, cache TTL, feature gates
  - 7th scoring factor `intel_boost` in `_recall.py` (neutral 1.0 when offline)

### Removed

- **Intelligence code deleted for IP protection** (PRD-INFRA-054)
  - `scoring/attribution/` — 7 files, 739 lines (extracted to backend)
  - `state/bandit_policy.py` — 362 lines (extracted to backend)

- `_session_recall_helpers.py` — resolve_client_class replaced with stub
- `server/_tools.py` — register_meta_tune_tools removed

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Surface area feature flags (PRD-CORE-125)** — All 13 LLM-influencing surfaces are now independently toggleable via TRWConfig fields. 15 new config fields across 4 domain mixins (`_CeremonyFields`: nudge_enabled, nudge_urgency_mode, nudge_budget_chars, nudge_dedup_enabled, hooks_enabled, framework_md_enabled, skills_enabled, agents_enabled; `_MemoryFields`: learning_recall_enabled, learning_injection_preview_chars, session_start_recall_enabled; new `_ToolsFields`: tool_exposure_mode, tool_exposure_list, tool_descriptions_variant, mcp_server_instructions_enabled). 5 new ClientProfile fields (nudge_enabled, tool_exposure_mode, learning_recall_enabled, mcp_instructions_enabled, skills_enabled) with all 6 built-in profiles updated. 8 `effective_*` properties on TRWConfig for profile-aware resolution. `TOOL_PRESETS` with 4 levels (core/minimal/standard/all). `SurfaceConfig` unified frozen model (`NudgeConfig`, `ToolExposureConfig`, `RecallConfig`). `resolve_surface()` function with dict dispatch. `ToolsConfig` sub-model. 10 production code gates (nudge, recall, tools, MCP instructions, hooks, framework ref, skills, agents, delegation, agent teams). 58 new tests.
- **Surface resolver** — `state/surface_resolver.py` provides a unified `resolve_surface(surface_id)` function that checks `config.surfaces` and returns empty string when a surface is disabled. Uses `_SURFACE_ENABLED_MAP` dict dispatch for clean extensibility. Foundation for PRD-CORE-126 content-as-data migration.
- **Tool exposure filtering** — `server/_tools.py:_apply_tool_exposure_filter()` uses `TOOL_PRESETS` to remove unneeded tools after registration via `FastMCP.remove_tool()`. Supports "all" (no-op), "core", "minimal", "standard", and "custom" modes. Fail-open on config errors.

### Fixed

- **Unwired ClientProfile facade flags** — 6 existing flags (`hooks_enabled`, `include_framework_ref`, `include_agent_teams`, `include_delegation`, `review_md_enabled`, `agents_md_enabled`) were declared on `ClientProfile` but never checked by production code. Now wired to `_static_sections.py` render functions and `session-start.sh`. Light profiles (opencode, codex, aider) correctly skip framework ref, delegation, and agent teams sections, saving ~2,100 tokens of context.

- **Complete ceremony nudge coverage (PRD-CORE-124)** — Wired nudge injection into 7 additional tools (trw_session_start, trw_init, trw_status, trw_checkpoint, trw_prd_create, trw_prd_validate, trw_deliver state). Coverage: 4/24 → 11/24 tools (all workflow-relevant). Added `ToolName.PRD_CREATE`, `ToolName.PRD_VALIDATE` constants, context-reactive messages for STATUS/PRD_CREATE/PRD_VALIDATE, and "review" step urgency-tier static messages.
- **File modification hydration** — `_hydrate_files_modified()` counts `file_modified` events from events.jsonl at nudge computation time, bridging the shell-hook/Python-state gap so checkpoint nudges accurately report "N files modified since last checkpoint".
- **Nudge system documentation** — `docs/documentation/nudge-system.md` (315 lines) covering architecture, tool coverage, message types, ceremony modes, budgets, and extension guide.
- **16 new nudge tests** — Tool response schema tests (init, status, checkpoint, prd_create, prd_validate), state mutation wiring tests (mark_session_started, mark_deliver, mark_checkpoint), hydration tests (5), context-reactive message tests (3).

### Fixed

- **mark_session_started() never called** — `trw_session_start` now calls `mark_session_started()` so `CeremonyState.session_started` reflects reality. Previously always `False`, causing incorrect "call session_start" nudges even after it ran.
- **mark_deliver() never called** — `trw_deliver` now calls `mark_deliver()` so `CeremonyState.deliver_called` reflects reality. Previously always `False`, causing unresolvable deliver nudge escalation.
- **mark_checkpoint() never called from trw_checkpoint** — `trw_checkpoint` now calls `mark_checkpoint()` to track checkpoint count and reset files-modified counter.
- **Missing exc_info in build_check nudge handler** — `build/_registration.py` now logs with `exc_info=True` so nudge failure tracebacks aren't silently lost.
- **Import inconsistency** — All tool-level nudge imports standardized to use `ceremony_nudge` public facade instead of private `_nudge_state` module. Added `record_nudge_shown` and `is_nudge_eligible` to facade exports.

### Improved

- **Learning prompting text quality (PRD-QUAL-057)** — Removed 3 unsourced quantitative claims ("3x fewer P0 defects", "80%+ of integration issues", "hundreds of past sessions") from CLAUDE.md static sections and messages.yaml. Updated stale docstrings referencing CLAUDE.md learning promotion (removed per PRD-CORE-093). Expanded `trw_recall()` ranking description to reflect actual 6-factor scoring. Fixed `server_instructions` inaccuracy about learnings being "lost" without deliver. Tightened high-urgency nudge repetition. Generalized Sprint 26 watchlist references. Added 9 step names to `trw_meta_tune()` docstring.

- **Nudge architecture and protocol deduplication (PRD-CORE-120)** — Removed protocol table emission from session-start hook on `startup` events (CLAUDE.md is single source of truth; hook still emits on `compact`/`clear`/`resume` for context recovery). Added hard character truncation at tier budget in `_assemble_nudge()` with `[truncated]` indicator. Budget-checked `reactive_msg` before inclusion. Added phase-to-message mapping rationale documentation in `_nudge_rules.py`.

- **Learning tool quality gates (PRD-CORE-119)** — Added quality gate guidance to `trw_learn()` docstring ("Only record learnings that prevent repeated mistakes..."). Expanded noise pattern detection from 2 to 6 prefix patterns plus 5 regex patterns covering file-read confirmations, test-pass notifications, edit confirmations, and status acknowledgments (23 tests). Documented `session_count` proxy limitation in `_memory_transforms.py` with PRD reference for proper fix.

### Fixed

- **Dedup re-learning loop fixed (PRD-CORE-042)** — `check_duplicate()` now checks obsolete/resolved entries for skip (>= 0.95 similarity), preventing the runaway loop where `session_start` injects content → agent re-learns it → deliver obsoletes it → next session repeats. Root cause: PRD-CORE-042-FR02 scoped dedup to active-only entries, but later systems (consolidation, outcome correlation) obsoleted entries that then got re-learned.
- **sqlite-vec KNN fast path for dedup** — `check_duplicate()` now tries `backend.search_vectors()` first (sub-ms KNN, status-agnostic) before falling back to the O(n) YAML linear scan that re-embeds every entry. Adds `_check_duplicate_via_backend()` and `_distance_to_similarity()` helpers.
- **Status-aware merge gating** — obsolete/resolved entries trigger `skip` (>= 0.95) but never `merge` (0.85–0.95), preventing knowledge from being appended into dead entries.
- **Recall/session-start masking preserves useful summary text** — observation masking now drops bulky recall context and per-learning noise before truncating, so `trw_session_start` and `trw_recall` responses keep substantially more of each learning summary.
- **Delivery/status masking is now structure-aware** — nested status blocks such as `reflect`, `checkpoint`, `claude_md_sync`, `run`, and related delivery metadata are shallow-compacted to keep key scalar fields while avoiding oversized nested payloads.
- **Compression regressions covered** — added focused middleware tests for recall-shaped and delivery-shaped payloads under compact and minimal observation-masking tiers.

## [0.39.2] — 2026-04-02

### Fixed

- **Installer config append corruption** — the bundled installer now normalizes trailing newlines before rewriting `.trw/config.yaml`, preventing appended `platform_urls:` blocks from being merged onto the previous line.
- **Platform URL rewrites are now idempotent** — updating an existing project replaces stale `platform_urls` entries in place instead of duplicating the block on each reinstall or upgrade.
- **Installer regression coverage expanded** — added tests for newline preservation and single-block `platform_urls` rewrites so Codex/CLI installs do not silently corrupt repo-local TRW config.

### Validation

- `trw-mcp/tests/test_installer_process.py`: `44` passed.

---

## [0.39.1] — 2026-04-02

### Fixed

- **Outcome-correlation persistence hardening** — `process_outcome()` now falls back to the canonical YAML ID scan when the summary-slug filename cannot be derived from the learning ID, so Q-value and outcome-history updates are persisted reliably alongside SQLite-backed entries.
- **Session-boundary regression coverage aligned** — correlation tests now create modern `.trw/runs/{task}/{run_id}/meta/run.yaml` run trees, matching the runtime scan path used for session-scoped rewards.
- **Template and learning-shape assertions normalized** — requirement and memory-transform tests now reflect template `2.3`, pre-seeded Q-values, and the current typed-learning response fields.

### Validation

- Full `trw-mcp` package suite passed: `5984` passed, `5` skipped, `3` xfailed.
- Ruff and strict mypy passed for `trw-mcp`.

## [0.39.0] — 2026-04-02

### Added — OpenCode Native Commands, Agents, and Curated Skills

- **Native OpenCode commands** — `init-project --ide opencode` and `update-project` now install `.opencode/commands/trw-deliver.md`, `.opencode/commands/trw-prd-ready.md`, and `.opencode/commands/trw-sprint-team.md`.
- **Specialist OpenCode agents** — TRW now ships `.opencode/agents/trw-researcher.md`, `.opencode/agents/trw-reviewer.md`, and `.opencode/agents/trw-implementer.md` with role-appropriate permissions and explicit output contracts.
- **Curated OpenCode skill subset** — reviewed OpenCode-safe skill variants now install into `.opencode/skills/` for `trw-deliver`, `trw-prd-ready`, `trw-framework-check`, and `trw-test-strategy`.
- **Inventory-backed compatibility policy** — new `data/opencode/skills_inventory.yaml` defines the supported phase-1 skill subset and explicitly excludes `trw-sprint-team` from default OpenCode skill exposure.

### Changed

- **Managed artifact lifecycle extended** — OpenCode commands, agents, and curated skills now participate in the same manifest-driven create/update/preserve/stale-cleanup flow as other managed client assets.
- **Update safety hardened** — `update-project` now preserves user-modified managed OpenCode artifacts by comparing against pre-update manifest hashes instead of clobbering local edits.
- **OpenCode documentation expanded** — `docs/CLIENT-PROFILES.md` now documents the managed OpenCode artifact surface, lifecycle rules, and intentional exclusions.
- **Bundle-sync coverage expanded** — `scripts/check-bundle-sync.sh` now validates the OpenCode skills inventory against bundled OpenCode variants.

### Tests

- Added OpenCode bootstrap coverage for command, agent, and curated-skill installation.
- Added update-project regression tests for preserving user-modified OpenCode commands, agents, and skills.
- Added stale-cleanup regression tests for removing manifest-tracked OpenCode commands, agents, and skills safely.

## [0.38.2] — 2026-04-02

### Fixed

- **`trw_build_check` correlation fan-out** — session-scoped outcome correlation now reads session boundaries from `.trw/runs` instead of `docs/*/runs`, so `trw_build_check` no longer falls back to the 480-minute window during normal runs.
- **Outcome rows excluded from recall correlation** — `correlate_recalls()` now ignores outcome-only `recall_tracking.jsonl` rows and only correlates actual recall receipts, preventing `build_check` from re-rewarding nearly the entire learning store.
- **Faster YAML path resolution for correlated entries** — when SQLite already has the learning entry, correlation resolves the YAML file via `find_yaml_path_for_entry()` instead of performing a full YAML scan per ID.

### Tests

- Added regression coverage for session boundary discovery from `.trw/runs` and for ignoring outcome-only tracking rows during correlation.

## [0.38.1] — 2026-04-02

### Added — Per-Client Instruction Files (PRD-CORE-115)

- **Per-client instruction renderers** — `render_codex_instructions()` and `render_opencode_instructions(model_family)` generate tailored `.codex/INSTRUCTIONS.md` and `.opencode/INSTRUCTIONS.md` instead of a shared AGENTS.md. Each client gets ceremony guidance optimized for its capabilities.
- **Model-family-specific headings and notes** — OpenCode instructions include model-specific workflow headings (`## GPT-5.4 Optimized Workflow`, `## Qwen-Coder-Next Optimized Workflow`, etc.) and `### {Family}-Specific Notes` sections with prompting guidance tailored to each model family.
- **Portable prompting guide loading** — Replaced hard-coded absolute paths with `importlib.resources.files()` for loading bundled model-family prompting guides (`data/prompting/*.md`).
- **Conditional checkpoint guidance** — Generic/limited-context models no longer receive `trw_checkpoint` references, respecting their constrained context budgets.

### Fixed

- **`generate_agents_md()` false error on double-write** — Fixed `if`/`if`/`else` logic bug where successful TRW marker replacement still triggered a "malformed TRW markers" error when AGENTS.md was written twice during `update_project(ide='all')`. Changed second `if` to `elif`.
- **Test alignment for 3-tuple `_determine_write_targets`** — Updated 7 tests in `test_target_platforms.py` to unpack the 3-value return `(write_claude, write_agents, instruction_path)`.
- **Bootstrap tests for per-client instructions** — Updated 6 tests in `test_bootstrap.py` to verify `.codex/INSTRUCTIONS.md` and `.opencode/INSTRUCTIONS.md` instead of the legacy shared `AGENTS.md` pattern.

---

## [0.38.0] — 2026-04-01

### Added — Meta-Learning Phase A (Sprint 80-82, PRD-CORE-110/111)

- **Typed learning model** — `LearningEntry` extended with 10 new fields: `type` (incident/pattern/convention/hypothesis/workaround), `nudge_line`, `expires`, `confidence`, `task_type`, `domain`, `phase_origin`, `phase_affinity`, `team_origin`, `protection_tier`. String-to-enum coercion via `mode="before"` validators.
- **Compact base-62 IDs** — `generate_learning_id()` now uses `generate_compact_id(prefix="L")` from trw-memory for shorter, more readable IDs (e.g., `L-a3Fq` instead of `L-4e4d6ca8`). Falls back to hex on import/runtime errors.
- **Code-grounded anchors** — `execute_learn()` auto-generates up to 3 code symbol anchors from `git diff` modified files via regex-based extraction (Python/JS/TS/Go/Rust). Anchors flow through `store_learning()` to SQLite.
- **Auto phase-origin detection** — `execute_learn()` auto-detects and uppercases the current ceremony phase when `phase_origin` is not explicitly provided.
- **Auto nudge_line** — Summary text is auto-truncated to 80 chars (word-boundary-preferring) as the nudge_line when not explicitly provided.
- **`trw_learn()` typed params** — 10 new parameters on the MCP tool surface for typed learning creation.
- **`trw_learn_update()` typed params** — 10 new update parameters with enum validation (rejects invalid type/confidence/protection_tier/phase_origin values).
- **Contextual recall scoring** — `RecallContext` dataclass with 6 boost dimensions (domain 1.4x, phase 1.3x, team 1.2x, outcome 1.5x/0.5x, anchor validity exclusion).
- **Type-aware decay** — `_TYPE_HALF_LIFE` dict with per-type half-lives (incident:90d, convention:365d, pattern:30d, hypothesis:7d, workaround:14d).

### Added — Meta-Learning Phase B (Sprint 83-84, PRD-CORE-103/104)

- **Delivery metrics pipeline** — New `_step_delivery_metrics()` deferred step in `trw_deliver()` computing rework_rate, composite_outcome, proximal_reward, learning_exposure, and normalized_reward at delivery time.
- **Learning-backed ceremony nudges** — `append_ceremony_nudge()` now queries learnings, uses `select_nudge_learning()` for dedup-aware selection, and appends a `TIP: <summary>` line to ceremony nudge text.
- **Surface logging for all channels** — `log_surface_event()` now wired for `session_start` (in `perform_session_recalls()`), `nudge` (in `append_ceremony_nudge()`), and `recall` (in `execute_recall()`).
- **Propensity logging** — `log_selection()` wired into the nudge selection path with candidate set, phase context, and exploration flag.
- **Nudge dedup** — `record_nudge_shown()` called after each learning-backed nudge to prevent re-showing the same learning in the same phase.

### Improved — DRY & Type Safety (Wave 3)

- **Shared `rotate_jsonl()`** — Extracted from `surface_tracking.py` and `propensity_log.py` into `state/_helpers.py`. Both modules now delegate to the shared implementation.
- **Canonical `VALID_SOURCES`** — Consolidated triplicated `_VALID_SOURCES` frozenset into `state/_constants.py`; consumers re-import from canonical source.
- **`ReworkRateResult` TypedDict** — `compute_rework_rate()` return type changed from `dict[str, object]` to typed `ReworkRateResult`.
- **`NudgeFatigueResult` TypedDict** — `check_nudge_fatigue()` return type changed from `dict[str, object]` to typed `NudgeFatigueResult`.
- **Unconditional Assertion/Anchor imports** — `_memory_transforms.py` imports `Assertion`, `Anchor`, `Confidence`, `MemoryType`, `ProtectionTier` unconditionally instead of behind try/except fallback.
- **`truncate_nudge_line()` helper** — Reusable word-boundary-aware truncation extracted to `_learning_helpers.py`.

---

## [0.37.2] — 2026-03-31

### Added

- **Learning source provenance (PRD-CORE-099)** — Every learning now records which IDE/client (`client_profile`) and AI model (`model_id`) created it. Auto-detected from environment signals (env vars, config files) for Claude Code, OpenCode, Cursor, Codex, and Aider. Explicit overrides available via `trw_learn()` parameters.
- **Source detection module** — New `trw_mcp.state.source_detection` with `detect_client_profile()` and `detect_model_id()` functions. Pure functions, no network calls, <1ms latency.
- **trw-memory schema migration** — `client_profile` and `model_id` columns added to SQLite `memories` table with backward-compatible `ALTER TABLE ADD COLUMN` migration.

### Improved

- **Type safety** — `LearningEntry.source_type` narrowed from `str` to `Literal["human", "agent", "tool", "consolidated"]`, aligned with `MemoryEntry.source`. Source-type validation in `_memory_transforms.py` replaced `cast` with runtime check. Analytics backfill expanded to accept all four valid source types.
- **API ergonomics** — `trw_learn()` `client_profile`/`model_id` use `None` sentinel (auto-detect) vs explicit `""` (suppress detection), preventing ambiguity.
- **DRY refactor** — `_save_yaml_backup` refactored from 16 positional params to use `LearningParams` dataclass + keyword-only args, preventing transposition bugs.
- **YAMLBackend fix** — `_dict_to_entry()` now reads `client_profile` and `model_id` from YAML data, preventing silent data loss on round-trip.
- **Test organization** — Source detection unit tests split from integration tests and registered in `_UNIT_FILES` for `make test-fast`. Added wiring integration tests, compact-mode exclusion tests, YAML round-trip tests, dual-config priority test, and secondary env-var coverage.

### Fixed

- **Export source_type violation** — `import_learning()` used `source_type="cross-project"` which failed Literal validation after wave 2 type narrowing. Changed to `"tool"` with provenance fields preserved from source entry.
- **LearningEntryDict TypedDict** — Added `client_profile` and `model_id` to the TypedDict so type-checked callers can see the fields.
- **CSV export** — `_learnings_to_csv()` now includes `client_profile` and `model_id` columns.
- **trw-memory migration** — `from_trw.py` now reads `client_profile` and `model_id` from YAML data during migration, preventing silent data loss.
- **Consolidation provenance** — Consolidated entries now inherit `client_profile`, `model_id`, and `source_identity` from the highest-importance source entry.
- **Output schema validation error** — Disabled FastMCP 3.x auto-inferred `outputSchema` on all 24 tools via `output_schema=None`. FastMCP 3.x infers output schemas from TypedDict return annotations and advertises them to clients, but the stdio proxy doesn't forward `structuredContent`, causing Claude Code to reject responses with "outputSchema defined but no structured output returned".

---

## [0.37.1] — 2026-03-31

### Fixed

- **Compact mode tag cap** — `_memory_to_learning_dict` now caps tags to 10 in compact mode, preventing oversized `trw_session_start` responses (99KB → ~5KB) caused by learnings with 400-672 tags.
- **Phase-contextual recall bounded** — `_phase_contextual_recall` changed from `max_results=0, compact=False` (unlimited full entries) to `max_results=15, compact=True`, preventing unbounded response growth.
- **opencode MCP transport** — `.opencode/opencode.json` switched from shared HTTP remote (`http://127.0.0.1:8100/mcp`) to stdio local transport. Only Claude Code should use the shared MCP server; other clients spawn their own `trw-mcp` process per session.

---

## [0.37.0] — 2026-03-31

### Added — Sprint 79: Architecture & Optimization

- **Config decomposition** — `_main_fields.py` split from 468 to 54 lines into 8 domain-specific mixin files (`_fields_scoring.py`, `_fields_memory.py`, `_fields_orchestration.py`, `_fields_telemetry.py`, `_fields_ceremony.py`, `_fields_build.py`, `_fields_trust.py`, `_fields_paths.py`). All consumer imports remain unchanged.
- **YAML response format** — New `response_format` config field with per-client-profile defaults. YAML serialization reduces tool response tokens ~20%. JSON fallback on error. Cursor stays on JSON, Claude Code/opencode default to YAML.
- **Agent roster consolidation** — 18 agents reduced to 5 focused agents (trw-implementer, trw-researcher, trw-reviewer, trw-auditor, trw-prd-groomer). 13 PREDECESSOR_MAP entries ensure clean upgrade path.
- **CLAUDE.md compression** — Root CLAUDE.md reduced from 299 to 177 lines. Deployment content extracted to `docs/deployment/CLAUDE.md`. Learning promotion removed from sync/deliver path.
- **Phase-change hook suppression** — `user-prompt-submit.sh` caches last phase, skipping redundant emissions. Hook invocations per session reduced from 20-100 to 3-5.
- **Contextual learning injection** — Keyword-based learning search injected on phase change with score threshold (0.7), token cap, and session dedup.
- **MCP Tool Search enablement** — `ENABLE_TOOL_SEARCH=true` in settings templates with smart-merge that preserves user opt-outs.
- **Installer auth skip** — Prior installations with existing API key skip the auth prompt.
- **Installer artifact cleanup** — Content hashing prevents overwriting user-modified agents. Stale artifacts detected and removed on upgrade.

### Fixed

- **Layer violations resolved** — Zero `state/` → `tools/` imports. Scoring modules accept callbacks instead of performing direct I/O.
- **Orchestration decomp** — Lifecycle helpers extracted to `_orchestration_lifecycle.py`. `orchestration.py` reduced to 448 lines.
- **behavioral_protocol.md context allowlist** — New state files (`behavioral_protocol.md`, `last_ups_phase`, `injected_learning_ids.txt`) added to context cleanup allowlist.
- **Per-profile response_format wiring** — Middleware now resolves active client profile format, not just global config.

---

## [0.36.1] — 2026-03-30

### Fixed

- **init_project preserved key guard** — guard against missing `preserved` key in `init_project` result to prevent KeyError in downstream consumers.
- **mypy --strict compliance** — resolved 15 strict type errors exposed after lint auto-corrections.
- **ruff lint** — included all `ruff --fix` auto-corrections that were missed in prior commits.
- **CI stability** — disabled test step in CI pipeline to save runner minutes while test suite stabilizes; lint and type-check still enforced.

---

## [0.36.0] — 2026-03-30

### Added — Codex Provider Support

- **Codex bootstrap** — full `init-project` and `update-project` support for OpenAI Codex CLI. Generates `.codex/` config directory with `config.toml` (MCP server wiring), `instructions.md` (learning-injected instructions), and `.agents/skills/` (bundled skill tree). New `_codex.py` bootstrap module (638 lines) with Codex-specific typed dicts.
- **CLI subcommands** — `trw-mcp init-project --codex` and `trw-mcp update-project --codex` for explicit Codex targeting. Auto-detected when `.codex/` directory exists.
- **Codex client profile** — light-ceremony profile with 32K context budget, IMPLEMENT+DELIVER phases only, and Codex-specific write targets (`instructions.md`, `config.toml`).
- **AGENTS.md Codex content** — `render_agents_trw_section()` produces Codex-compatible content free of Claude Code-specific language.

### Fixed

- **Codex skill path normalization** — Skill entries in `.codex/config.toml` now point to the containing directory (`.agents/skills/trw-deliver`) instead of the SKILL.md file. Existing configs with `/SKILL.md` suffixes are normalized on update.
- **Codex bootstrap stability** — monorepo environment detection fixed to prevent `FileNotFoundError` when data directories resolve outside the installed package.

---

## [0.35.2] — 2026-03-29

### Fixed

- **Codex skill path normalization** — Skill entries in `.codex/config.toml` now point to the containing directory (`.agents/skills/trw-deliver`) instead of the SKILL.md file (`.agents/skills/trw-deliver/SKILL.md`). Existing configs with `/SKILL.md` suffixes are normalized on update. Fixes Codex skill resolution which expects directory paths.

---

## [0.35.1] — 2026-03-29

### Fixed — Framework Excellence Sprint (Sprint 77)

**P0 Security fixes**:
- `security-patterns.sh`: Unclosed string literal on SEC-003 silently disabled 7 of 9 OWASP security pattern checks (SEC-003 through SEC-009). Only eval/exec and os.system detection was functional.
- `smoke-test.sh`: Eliminated `eval`-based command injection via `$BACKEND_URL` environment variable by replacing string evaluation with direct command execution.

**Dev/bundled sync (18 agents, 11 skills, 6 hooks)**:
- Synced all shared files between `.claude/` (dev) and `data/` (bundled) — user installations were receiving stale agent instructions, missing hook functions, and incomplete skill definitions.
- `lib-trw.sh`: Bundled version was missing `has_recent_deliver()` and dual-pattern run scanning for `.trw/runs/`, causing silent hook degradation in user projects.
- Added `scripts/check-bundle-sync.sh` — CI-integrated check that prevents dev/bundled divergence. Integrated into `make check` pipeline.

**Installer and script hardening (12 fixes)**:
- `install.sh`: Fixed broken `--api-key KEY` argument parsing (`shift` inside `for` loop is a no-op), added pip error diagnostics.
- `deploy.sh`: Fixed POSIX `TMPDIR` env var collision, replaced bare `pip` with `python3 -m pip`, moved Lambda ZIP to scoped temp directory.
- `aws-login.sh`: Replaced dead WSL2 code with cross-platform browser detection, corrected `aws login` to `aws sso login`.
- `verify-installer.sh`: Fixed command injection in `sg docker` re-exec, replaced obfuscated `chr()` Python code.
- `publish-release.sh`: Added macOS `shasum -a 256` fallback for `sha256sum`.
- `pre-commit.sh`: Fixed glob patterns that missed nested Python files, added `.venv` existence check.
- `setup-hooks.sh`: Added git repo validation and idempotency.
- `teammate-idle.sh`: Added path traversal sanitization on team name.
- `check-comment-replacement.sh`: Added `jq` availability guard, fixed shebang to `#!/bin/sh`.

## [0.35.0] — 2026-03-29

### Changed — Architecture & Code Quality Sprint (PRD-FIX-061 through PRD-FIX-066)

**Layer violation resolution (P0, PRD-FIX-061)**:
- `is_noise_summary()` moved from `tools/_learning_helpers.py` to `state/analytics/core.py` — eliminates `state/ → tools/` inverted dependency
- `_merge_session_events()` moved from `tools/_deferred_delivery.py` to `state/_session_events.py`
- `scoring/_utils.py` no longer re-exports `FileStateReader`/`FileStateWriter` in `__all__`
- Backward-compatible re-exports preserve all existing import paths

**Module decomposition — 6 oversized files split into 13 focused modules (PRD-FIX-064)**:
- `tools/learning.py` 738→326 lines (extracted `_learn_impl.py`, `_recall_impl.py`)
- `tools/_review_helpers.py` 684→207 lines (extracted `_review_auto.py`, `_review_manual.py`, `_review_multi.py`)
- `bootstrap/_template_updater.py` 677→415 lines (extracted `_ide_targets.py`)
- `bootstrap/_utils.py` 676→473 lines (extracted `_file_ops.py`, `_mcp_json.py`)
- `state/ceremony_feedback.py` 686→378 lines (extracted `_ceremony_sanitize.py`, `_ceremony_escalation.py`)
- `state/analytics/report.py` 692→466 lines (extracted `_stale_runs.py`)

**Exception policy enforcement (PRD-FIX-062)**:
- All 19 `except Exception` blocks now carry `# justified: <category>` comments per package policy
- `_locking.py` extracted — DRY portable `fcntl` shim replaces duplicated code in `persistence.py` and `telemetry/pipeline.py`
- `server/_proxy.py` guarded against Windows `fcntl` import crash

**API surface cleanup (PRD-FIX-063)**:
- `_reset_config` renamed to `reload_config()` with backward-compat alias — docstring updated to reflect production use
- `_ModuleProxy` test infrastructure removed from `tools/requirements.py`
- `DeprecationWarning` added to `_compat_getattr()` shim (9 modules) with v1.0 removal target
- Ruff test ignores narrowed from `"S"` (all Bandit) to `"S101"` (assert only)

**Code quality polish (PRD-FIX-066)**:
- `api/__init__.py` — new thin public API module exporting 22 key types for external integrators
- `_build_middleware()` refactored into 4 named helpers (`_try_init_ceremony`, `_try_init_progressive`, etc.)
- `memory_adapter.py` re-exports consolidated from 35 individual imports to 4 grouped blocks
- `state/claude_md/_sync.py` decomposed — REVIEW.md and AGENTS.md generation extracted to `_review_md.py` and `_agents_md.py`
- `state/memory/__init__.py` re-exports grouped by subsystem with section comments

### Added

- **`CONTRIBUTING.md`** — contributor guide with prerequisites, dev setup, testing, architecture overview, commit format (PRD-FIX-065)
- **Configuration section in README** — annotated example `.trw/config.yaml` with top settings and defaults
- **Debugging section in README** — `--debug` flag, log location, `TRW_LOG_LEVEL` env var
- **"See Also" cross-links** in 5 core tool docstrings (`trw_learn`, `trw_recall`, `trw_session_start`, `trw_deliver`, `trw_prd_create`)
- **CLI typo correction** — `trw-mcp init-proyect` now suggests "Did you mean: init-project?"
- **`init-project` success message** — prints next-step guidance after bootstrapping
- 4 sensitive key patterns added to structlog redaction: `client_secret`, `refresh_token`, `jwt`, `id_token`
- New test files: `test_api_surface.py`, `test_app_middleware_helpers.py`, `test_devex_fix065.py`

### Fixed

- `server/_tools.py` docstring: "19 tools" corrected to "24 tools"
- `auto_upgrade.py` imports locking from canonical `_locking.py` instead of `persistence.py` private attrs
- `_review_multi.py` and `_review_helpers._invoke_cross_model_review` now use `TRWConfig` type (was `object`)

## [0.34.1] — 2026-03-28

### Added — Final DevEx Polish (PRD-QUAL-052)

- **`trw-mcp config-reference`** — CLI subcommand that auto-generates markdown config reference from Pydantic field metadata. Never goes stale.
- **`trw-mcp uninstall`** — CLI subcommand to remove TRW files from a project. Supports `--dry-run` and `--yes` flags.
- **SKILL.md validation** — `_install_skills()` now validates required frontmatter fields (name, description) and skips malformed skills with a warning.
- **3 new test files** — `test_skill_validation.py`, `test_config_reference.py`, `test_uninstall.py`.

## [0.34.0] — 2026-03-28

### Added — Code Quality Sprint (PRD-QUAL-047, PRD-QUAL-048, PRD-CORE-089, PRD-QUAL-049)

- **`create_app()` factory function** — `server/_app.py` now provides `create_app(instructions=..., middleware=...)` for testing and embedding. Module-level `mcp` singleton preserved for backward compatibility.
- **`py.typed` PEP 561 marker** — enables downstream type checking for library consumers.
- **`--version` CLI flag** — `trw-mcp -V` prints package version.
- **`--api-url` auth CLI override** — `trw-mcp auth login --api-url <url>` for testing alternate endpoints.
- **`suggestion` field on TRWError** — exception hierarchy supports remediation hints.
- **Troubleshooting section in README** — 4 common issues documented.
- **`state/README.md` ownership map** — navigation guide for the 71-module state directory.
- **`__all__` declarations** on exceptions, middleware, and persistence modules.

### Changed

- **TRWConfig decomposed** — 790-line god-class split into `_main_fields.py` (468 lines, all field declarations) + `_main.py` (138 lines, properties and methods). Both under the 500-line review threshold. (PRD-CORE-090)
- **Circular imports eliminated: 8 → 1** — extracted `_deferred_state.py` (ceremony↔deferred), moved `_STEPS` to `_nudge_state.py` (nudge cycle), moved `VALID_TRANSITIONS` to `models/requirements.py` (prd_utils↔prd_status), refactored review↔helpers, added TYPE_CHECKING guard for tiers↔sweep. Only benign `models` self-ref remains.
- **Middleware test coverage added** — 4 new/expanded test files for ceremony, context_budget, response_optimizer, and compression middleware.
- **Thread-safe session identity** — `_session_id` and `_pinned_runs` in `state/_paths.py` now protected by `threading.Lock`.
- **`_app.py` middleware init** — single `get_config()` call (was doubled), `sys.stderr.write` replaced with `structlog.warning`.
- **`_deferred_delivery.py` re-exports** — consolidated from 44 lines to 15 (grouped imports).
- **`trw-memory` pinned** to `>=0.3.0,<1.0.0` (was `>=0.1.0`).
- **ruff lint zero errors** — 39 errors resolved via per-file-ignores and auto-fix.
- **Deprecated ANN101/ANN102** rules removed from ruff config.

### Fixed

- **Python version check in installer** — `install-trw.py` now validates Python ≥3.10 at startup.
- **CHANGELOG version gaps** — 0.26.0 and 0.27.0 documented as internal (not published to PyPI).
- **Silent JSON parse in auth** — `cli/auth.py` error body parse failure now documented with justification comment.

## [0.33.0] — 2026-03-28

### Added — Session Resilience Hardening (PRD-QUAL-050)

- **Tool invocation heartbeat** (FR-01/FR-02) — Touches `meta/heartbeat` file on every MCP tool invocation so long-running sessions without checkpoints are not incorrectly abandoned. `_is_run_stale()` now considers heartbeat mtime alongside checkpoint timestamps, using whichever is more recent. Runs without heartbeat files fall back to checkpoint-only detection (backward compatible).
- **Session boundary in trw_init** (FR-03/FR-04) — `trw_init()` now appends a `session_start` event to events.jsonl, ensuring delivery gates always have a session boundary marker. If `trw_session_start()` is called afterward, its `session_start` event naturally supersedes.
- **Proactive WAL checkpoint management** (FR-05/FR-06) — During `trw_session_start()` auto-maintenance, if the SQLite WAL file exceeds a configurable threshold (default 10 MB), runs `PRAGMA wal_checkpoint(TRUNCATE)`. WAL file size is included in embeddings health reporting when above threshold. New config: `wal_checkpoint_threshold_mb`.

### Fixed

- **Stale run blocking delivery** — Fixed 4 interacting bugs where `trw_deliver()` was blocked by file_modified events from previous sessions:
  - Shell hook `find_active_run()` now checks `run.yaml` status, skipping abandoned/complete/delivered runs
  - Python `find_active_run()` now skips `"abandoned"` and `"delivered"` statuses (was only skipping `"complete"` and `"failed"`)
  - `trw_deliver()` now calls `_mark_run_complete()` after successful delivery (was defined but never called)
  - Delivery gate uses session-scoped counting: `_events_since_last_session_start()` isolates current session's file_modified events from previous sessions'
  - Shell hook scans both `runs_root` (`.trw/runs/`) and `task_root` (`docs/`) for active runs
  - Added `has_recent_deliver()` to shell hooks for parallel instance detection

## [0.32.3] — 2026-03-28

### Fixed

- **Use `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR` for hook paths** — Replaced `git rev-parse` with Claude Code's built-in `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR` env var for hook path resolution. No git dependency, submodule-safe, worktree-safe. `lib-trw.sh` `get_repo_root()` falls back to git for non-Claude contexts.

## [0.32.2] — 2026-03-28

### Fixed

- **Submodule-safe hook path resolution** — Hook commands used `git rev-parse --git-common-dir` which resolves to `.git/modules/<name>` inside submodules, breaking all hooks with ENOENT. Switched to `--show-toplevel` which works correctly for regular repos, worktrees, and submodules.

## [0.32.1] — 2026-03-26

### Fixed

- **Non-blocking browser open** — `webbrowser.open()` now runs in a daemon thread to avoid blocking the main thread on Linux. URL displays immediately; browser opens in the background. Same pattern used by Jupyter/IPython.
- **PostgreSQL timezone fix** — `/auth/device/token` polling returned 500 because `DateTime(timezone=True)` columns return tz-aware datetimes on PostgreSQL but the comparison used naive datetimes. Added `_make_tz_aware()` helper for cross-DB compatibility.
- **Auto-approve after login redirect** — `/device` page appends `&auto=1` to the login callback URL. On return from login, the approval submits automatically — no more clicking Approve twice.

## [0.32.0] — 2026-03-26

### Added

- **Executable assertions integration** (PRD-CORE-086) — machine-verifiable assertions flow through the full learning lifecycle. No new MCP tools — integrated entirely into existing workflows.
  - `trw_learn()` accepts optional `assertions` parameter (list of grep/glob assertion dicts)
  - `trw_learn_update()` can add, modify, or remove assertions on existing learnings
  - `trw_recall()` runs lazy verification on recalled entries with assertions; failing assertions get a configurable utility score penalty (default -0.15)
  - `trw_session_start()` includes assertion health summary (`passing`, `failing`, `stale` counts)
  - `rank_by_utility()` applies `assertion_penalties` dict for score adjustments
  - `TRWConfig`: new `assertion_failure_penalty` (0.15) and `assertion_stale_threshold_days` (30) fields
  - `LearningParams`, `store_learning()`, `_learning_to_memory_entry()`, `_memory_to_learning_dict()` all thread assertions end-to-end
- **PRD assertion support** — PRD template includes optional `Assertions:` subsection per FR; `trw_prd_validate` awards bonus traceability points for assertion coverage
- **Skill prompt updates** — 6 skills updated with assertion guidance: `/trw-prd-groom` (suggestion), `/trw-audit` (evidence), `/trw-memory-audit` (health reporting), `/trw-memory-optimize` (verification wave with subagent investigation), `/trw-exec-plan` (task verification steps)
- **17 new tests** across 3 test files covering learn/update/recall assertion threading, penalty scoring, and lifecycle.

---

## [0.31.1] — 2026-03-26

### Fixed

- **Device auth UX** — CLI now shows the complete URL with code embedded (`/device?code=XXXX-XXXX`) instead of displaying the URL and code separately. When the browser opens successfully, shows a single confirmation line. When it can't, shows one copyable URL.
- **`tools/build` missing from wheel** — `.gitignore` had unanchored `build/` which excluded `src/trw_mcp/tools/build/` from the published package. Anchored to `/build/` so only the root build directory is ignored.
- **`install.sh` served from platform** — added to `platform/public/` so `curl -fsSL https://trwframework.com/install.sh | bash` works via Amplify without a separate CDN setup.
- **trw-shared removed from build chain** — `Makefile`, `build_installer.py`, and installer template no longer reference the inlined trw-shared package.

## [0.31.0] — 2026-03-25

### Added

- **Device auth CLI client** (`cli/auth.py`) — RFC 8628 device authorization flow using only Python stdlib (`urllib.request`, `webbrowser`). Includes `device_auth_login()` with browser auto-open, polling with spinner/countdown, `slow_down`/`expired_token`/`access_denied` handling, exponential backoff on network errors, and `select_organization()` for multi-org users. (PRD-CORE-087)
- **`trw-mcp auth` commands** — `login` (device flow), `logout` (remove API key), `status` (show org/email/key prefix). Wired into CLI dispatch via `_subcommands.py` and `_cli.py`.
- **Installer device auth integration** — `_prompt_api_key()` in `install-trw.template.py` now tries device auth first, falls back to manual key paste. Accepts `trw_dk_` key prefix. New `--skip-auth` flag to skip platform connection entirely.
- **Bootstrap script** (`scripts/install.sh`) — lightweight bash script for `curl -fsSL https://trwframework.com/install.sh | bash`. Checks Python 3.10+, `pip install trw-mcp` with fallbacks, `init-project`, optional device auth. Supports `--api-key`, `--skip-auth`, and `TRW_API_KEY` env var for CI/CD.
- **Config persistence** — `run_auth_login` saves `platform_org_name` and `platform_user_email` alongside `platform_api_key` in `.trw/config.yaml`. `auth status` displays all three.
- **52 new tests** — 38 CLI tests (`test_cli_auth.py`) + 14 subcommand tests (`test_cli_auth_subcommand.py`) covering polling, org selector, config operations, and command dispatch.

## [0.30.0] — 2026-03-25

### Added

- **Observation masking middleware** (`telemetry/context_budget.py`, `telemetry/_compression.py`) — new `ContextBudgetMiddleware` implements 3-tier progressive verbosity (full/compact/minimal) that reduces tool response tokens as sessions grow longer. Tier transitions driven by per-session turn count; redundancy detection via SHA-256 hashing suppresses repeated identical responses. Registered in `_build_middleware()` between `ProgressiveDisclosureMiddleware` and `ResponseOptimizerMiddleware`. Config fields: `observation_masking` (bool), `compact_after_turns` (default 20), `minimal_after_turns` (default 40). 28 tests covering tiers, compression, redundancy, config, and fail-open behavior. Motivated by JetBrains Research (Dec 2025): 52% cost reduction with only 2.6% quality degradation.
- **Open-source publication prep** — `pyproject.toml` license set to `BUSL-1.1`, `README.md` rewritten for public audience, competitive research documents removed from the published artifact, secrets baseline scrubbed.

### Fixed

- **Restored full CLAUDE.md behavioral protocol** — all ceremony sections (delegation, phases, tool lifecycle, rationalization watchlist, Agent Teams protocol, example flows, promoted learnings) are rendered again. These were incorrectly suppressed with empty strings during a prior refactor intended only for light-mode platforms (opencode, local models).
- **CLAUDE.md cache invalidation on upgrade** — `_compute_sync_hash()` now includes the package version, so any `trw-mcp` version bump automatically forces a re-render across all projects. Previously, upgrading with unchanged learnings would serve stale cached content.
- **`max_auto_lines` default** — bumped from 80 to 300 to accommodate the full rendered section (~168 lines).
- **Dead `_writer` parameter removed** — `_step_telemetry` and related ceremony helpers had an unused `FileStateWriter` parameter that was never consumed; removed across 4 call sites. Fixes 13 test isolation failures caused by stale writer references.

---

## [0.29.1] — 2026-03-22

### Fixed

- **Installer hang without API key** — `_run_claude_md_sync` now skips the LLM CLAUDE.md sync step when `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is not set, preventing the installer from hanging for up to 180 seconds when run outside a Claude Code session.
- **Embeddings never backfilled during install** — `update-project` now runs an auto-maintenance step (embeddings backfill + stale run closure) locally after install, without requiring an API key. First installs with `--ai` now backfill embeddings immediately.
- **Auto-maintenance progress output** — `on_progress` callback passed through to `_run_auto_maintenance` so the installer spinner updates during the embeddings backfill phase. Warning emitted when embeddings are enabled but `sentence-transformers` is unavailable.

---

## [0.29.0] — 2026-03-22

### Fixed

- **Recall union search** — `trw_recall` now performs a union of keyword and vector results before ranking, fixing cases where keyword-only or vector-only matches were silently dropped.
- **Learning publish schema** — `source_learning_id` field correctly serialized in the batch publish payload; fixes backend upsert matching for learning entries published from projects with non-UUID local IDs.
- **Installer embeddings UX** — improved progress messaging during first-time embedding generation ("Backfilling embeddings (this may take 30–60s on first run)...").

---

## [0.28.0] — 2026-03-20

### Fixed

- **Installer `trw-shared` wheel missing** — `trw-mcp` declares `trw-shared>=0.1.0` as a dependency but the installer only bundled `trw-memory` and `trw-mcp` wheels. `pip install` failed with "No matching distribution found for trw-shared" on every fresh install. Installer now bundles all three wheels in dependency order: `trw-shared` → `trw-memory` → `trw-mcp`.

### Changed

- **`trw-shared` telemetry constants inlined** — after the `trw-shared` wheel bundling fix, `EventType`, `Phase`, `Status` constants and `MAPPED_FIELDS` frozenset from `trw_shared.telemetry` are now the authoritative source used by `trw-mcp` telemetry models (`SessionStartEvent`, `ToolInvocationEvent`, `CeremonyComplianceEvent`, `SessionEndEvent`). Inline string literals replaced throughout `telemetry/` subpackage.

---

## [0.27.0] — 2026-03-19

*Not published to PyPI — internal development version.*

### Changed

- **Framework version bump to v24.4_TRW** — coordinated version bump across all 5 monorepo packages.
- **Structured logging overhaul** — `structlog` wired across all tool and state modules with consistent field naming.
- **150 cross-package integration tests** — new test suites covering tool → state → persistence boundaries.
- **Agent Teams worktree merge fix** — worktree branches now merge before cleanup, preventing work loss.

---

## [0.26.0] — 2026-03-19

*Not published to PyPI — internal development version.*

### Changed

- **Structured logging overhaul** — extracted dedicated `_logging.py` module from `server/_app.py` with CLI flags (`-v/--verbose`, `-q/--quiet`, `--log-level`, `--log-json`). All 82 source files migrated from bare `structlog.get_logger()` to `structlog.get_logger(__name__)` for proper component attribution. ~30 `print()` statements converted to structured logger calls.
- **Silent error visibility** — added `exc_info=True` debug logging to 27 bare `except: pass` blocks (PRD-FIX-043 compliance). Log event names normalized to `snake_case` throughout.

### Added

- **26 unit tests for `_logging.py`** — covers verbosity levels, env var resolution, secret redaction, and component extraction.

---

## [0.25.0] — 2026-03-18

### Added

- **Memory routing section** — new `render_memory_harmonization()` auto-injected into CLAUDE.md to disambiguate `trw_learn()` vs Claude Code's native auto-memory. Uses table comparison and concrete routing examples. Claude Code-specific — not included in AGENTS.md.
- **Test for memory harmonization** — verifies routing guidance content, Claude Code specificity, and table structure.

### Changed

- **Optimized CLAUDE.md auto-section** — 41% token reduction (460 → 271 words) while adding memory routing content. Eliminated redundancy between imperative opener and ceremony quick-ref. Switched tool reference from bullet list to table format for scannability.
- **`render_imperative_opener()`** — tightened to role-only framing with brief tool mentions (detailed table now in ceremony quick-ref).
- **`render_ceremony_quick_ref()`** — restructured from bullet list to `| Tool | When | What |` table format.
- **`render_framework_reference()`** — compressed from 5 lines to 2, removed threat framing.

## [0.22.0] — 2026-03-18

### Added

- **ClientProfile system** — per-platform behavioral adaptation via frozen Pydantic models. Five built-in profiles (claude-code, opencode, cursor, codex, aider) with calibrated ceremony weights, scoring dimensions, write targets, and feature flags. See [`docs/CLIENT-PROFILES.md`](../docs/CLIENT-PROFILES.md).
- **Profile-aware ceremony scoring** — `compute_ceremony_score()` accepts optional `CeremonyWeights`. Both production call sites now pass the active profile's weights.
- **Profile-aware write targets** — `_determine_write_targets()` delegates to `ClientProfile.write_targets` for known clients.
- **7 delivery gate structural fixes** (Sprint 77 postmortem): review scope block (R-01), complexity drift warning (R-02/R-05), PRD deferral detection (R-03), wiring test mandate (R-04), anti-pattern recall alerts (R-06), checkpoint blocker warning (R-07).
- **DRY delivery gate helpers** — `_read_run_events()`, `_read_run_yaml()`, `_count_file_modified()` — events.jsonl read once per delivery.

### Fixed

- Facade-only ClientProfile wiring — weights and write targets now consumed by production code.
- Phase case normalization — `mandatory_phases` stored lowercase to match `Phase` enum.
- Parallel `_CEREMONY_WEIGHTS` dict replaced with `CeremonyWeights().as_dict()`.
- `@cached_property` → `@property` on `TRWConfig.client_profile` (stale data risk).
- Negative weights now rejected via `Field(ge=0)`.
- Stale `.pyc` files and comments cleaned up.
- `_resolve_installation_id` wrappers removed, direct imports inlined.

## [0.21.0] — 2026-03-17

### Added

- **Response optimizer middleware** — new `ResponseOptimizerMiddleware` intercepts all MCP tool responses and compacts JSON for LLM context efficiency: rounds floats to 2 decimal places, strips null values and empty collections, re-serializes with compact separators (no whitespace). Reduces token consumption across all 24 tools with zero per-tool changes.

### Fixed

- **`status` column always NULL for tool invocations** — `_write_tool_event` now emits `status: "success"/"error"` (string) in addition to `success` (bool), so the backend's `telemetry_events.status` column is correctly populated instead of all values falling into the `payload` JSON.
- **`error_type` never populated** — tool invocation events now include `error_type` with the exception class name (e.g., `"ValueError"`), enabling dashboard error-type breakdowns.

### Added

- **`trw-shared` telemetry contract** — new `shared/` monorepo package (`trw_shared.telemetry`) provides `EventType`, `Phase`, `Status` constants and `MAPPED_FIELDS` frozenset as the single source of truth for telemetry field names across trw-mcp and backend.
- **Grafana dashboard rewrite** — rebuilt `trw-overview.json` from 5 panels to 25 panels across 7 sections: Overview KPIs, Event Volume & Latency (P50/P95/P99), Tool Analysis (top tools + error rates), Ceremony & Workflow (score trend + phase donut), LLM Usage & Build Quality, Learnings & Errors (table), Sessions & Coverage + LLM Cost. All queries use `$__timeFilter(created_at)` for proper time-range integration. Wired to all 6 DB tables: `telemetry_events`, `shared_learnings`, `organizations`, `users`, `api_keys`, `audit_events`.

### Changed

- **Telemetry models use shared constants** — `SessionStartEvent`, `ToolInvocationEvent`, `CeremonyComplianceEvent`, `SessionEndEvent` now reference `EventType.*` and `Status.*` from `trw_shared.telemetry` instead of inline string literals.
- **`ToolEventDataDict`** — added `status` and `error_type` fields to the TypedDict for type-safe telemetry emission.

## [0.20.1] — 2026-03-16

### Fixed

- **Installer hang on extras detection** — `_detect_installed_extras()` now uses a 10-second timeout for import checks that previously could stall indefinitely on PEP 668 system Python without a venv.
- **Installer hang on subprocess calls** — `run_with_progress()` now has a configurable watchdog timer (default 180s) that kills stalled subprocesses. Previously, a hanging `trw-mcp update-project` or CLAUDE.md sync would block the installer indefinitely.

## [0.20.0] — 2026-03-15

### Added

- **Multi-platform ceremony adaptation** (PRD-CORE-084) — `ceremony_mode` config field (`"full"` | `"light"`) controls ceremony depth for non-Claude Code platforms. Light mode uses `render_minimal_protocol()` (< 200 tokens) and caps recall to 10 learnings for small context windows.
- **Learning injection into AGENTS.md** — high-impact learnings (impact >= 0.7) are now injected into the AGENTS.md auto-generated section during `trw_deliver()`, matching the CLAUDE.md learning promotion behavior. Controlled by `agents_md_learning_injection` config (default: `true`).
- **Platform-generic AGENTS.md content** — `render_agents_trw_section()` produces content free of Claude Code-specific language (no Agent Teams, subagents, slash commands, or FRAMEWORK.md references). AGENTS.md is now suitable for opencode, Cursor, Codex, and other MCP-capable platforms.
- **`target_platforms` config field** — list of platforms to sync instruction files for during deliver/sync. Installer auto-detects IDEs; updater keeps the field in sync when IDEs are added/removed.
- **Tool relevance tiers documentation** — TRW_README.md includes a "Local Model Guide" with Essential/Recommended/Optional tool classification for context-constrained environments.
- **Platform adaptation research** — `docs/research/platform-adaptation-research.md` with compatibility matrix, eval analysis, and TRW-light protocol design.

### Fixed

- **Cursor platform routing** — single-platform `target_platforms: ["cursor"]` now routes directly instead of falling to auto-detect.
- **UTF-8 encoding** in `_update_config_target_platforms()` — matches all other bootstrap file operations.
- **Empty "Key Learnings" header** — sanitized-away summaries no longer produce a spurious section header.
- **`query_matched` inflation** — focused recall count computed before merge with baseline results.
- **DRY in render functions** — extracted `_SESSION_BOUNDARY_TEXT` constant shared across renderers.

### Changed

- **Renamed `_do_claude_md_sync` → `_do_instruction_sync`** — platform-generic naming reflecting multi-platform support.
- **AGENTS.md size gate** — warning logged when auto-generated section exceeds `max_auto_lines`.

## [0.19.2] — 2026-03-15

### Changed

- **Ruff lint enforcement** — expanded from 14 to 26 rule sets (added C4, PERF, G, S, DTZ, FURB, C901, ANN). 244 violations fixed, 0 remaining. All test noqa comments eliminated.
- **noqa reduction** — source noqa reduced from 292 to 130 (all justified security/complexity suppressions). Test noqa reduced from 117 to 0.
- **Code simplification** — consolidated duplicate imports in `learning.py`, extracted `_parse_version()` in `auto_upgrade.py`, simplified `ceremony_nudge.py` variable naming.
- **C901 complexity** — decomposed 9 of 29 complex functions. Remaining 25 are core ceremony/registration functions with justified suppressions.
- **Ruff format** — `make format-python` target added for consistent formatting.
- **Pre-commit hooks** — 11 hooks including ruff, ruff-format, detect-secrets, check-ast, check-yaml, check-toml.
- **Quality baselines** — vulture dead code, deptry dependency hygiene, pyright type checking baselines documented.
- **Custom semgrep rules** — 4 rules: no-datetime-now-without-tz, no-bare-except, no-print-statements, mcp-tools-must-have-docstrings.
- **pip-audit CVE scanning** — `make vuln-scan` target with severity filtering.
- **CI hardening** — ruff check + ruff format --check added to mcp-ci.yml.

## [0.19.1] — 2026-03-15

### Fixed

- **Installer hang on extras detection** — `_detect_installed_extras()` now uses a 10-second timeout (was 120s). Import checks for `anthropic` and `sqlite_vec` that hang on system Python without a venv no longer block the installer for 2+ minutes.
- **Installer hang on project setup** — `run_with_progress()` now has a 180-second watchdog timer (`threading.Timer`) that kills stalled subprocesses. Previously, a hanging `trw-mcp update-project` would block the installer indefinitely.
- **CLAUDE.md sync blocking on ThreadPoolExecutor shutdown** — `_run_claude_md_sync()` now calls `pool.shutdown(wait=False, cancel_futures=True)` instead of relying on the `with` context manager's `__exit__`. The old code blocked indefinitely in `shutdown(wait=True)` when `LLMClient()` initialization hung in the worker thread.
- **Timeout observability** — `run_with_progress()` now warns users when a subprocess is killed by the watchdog timeout. `_run_claude_md_sync()` emits structured log events (`claude_md_sync_completed`, `claude_md_sync_timeout`, `claude_md_sync_failed`) for all sync outcomes.

## [0.19.0] — 2026-03-15

### Added

- **Configurable `runs_root`** — new config field `runs_root` (default: `.trw/runs`) controls where run artifacts (events, checkpoints, reports) are stored. Each `trw_init` creates `{runs_root}/{task_name}/{run_id}/`. Previously runs were nested under `{task_root}/{task_name}/runs/` which mixed run artifacts with documentation.
- **`--runs-root` CLI flag** — `trw-mcp init-project --runs-root <path>` sets the run directory at install time. The generated `.trw/config.yaml` includes inline comments explaining the field.
- **`.trw/runs` bootstrapped at install** — the directory is now created during `init-project` alongside other `.trw/` subdirectories.
- **Config reference updated** — `runs_root` documented in `config_reference.md` with description and example.

### Changed

- **Run directory structure simplified** — runs now live at `.trw/runs/{task}/{run_id}/` instead of `docs/{task}/runs/{run_id}/`. Removes the redundant intermediate `runs/` directory since the root is already semantically a runs directory.
- **FRAMEWORK.md variables updated** — `RUNS_ROOT` added, `RUN_ROOT` redefined as `{RUNS_ROOT}/{TASK}/{RUN_ID}`.

## [0.18.0] — 2026-03-14

### Added

- **Multi-platform instruction sync** — new `target_platforms` config field controls which instruction files (CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md, etc.) are written during `trw_deliver()` and `trw_claude_md_sync()`. Supports `claude-code`, `opencode`, `cursor`, `codex`, `aider` as a list. Installer auto-detects platforms and writes config; updater keeps it in sync when IDEs are added/removed.
- **Updater config sync** — `update-project` now detects IDE changes and updates `target_platforms` in `.trw/config.yaml` via selective YAML merge (preserves all other user config).

### Changed

- **Renamed `_do_claude_md_sync` → `_do_instruction_sync`** — internal function name and comments updated to be platform-generic, reflecting multi-platform support.

## [0.17.0] — 2026-03-14

### Fixed

- **Installer pip install timeout** — `_run_quiet` now has a 120-second timeout to prevent hangs when pip stalls on PEP 668 externally-managed system Pythons without a venv activated. Previously would hang indefinitely on `--break-system-packages` fallback.

## [0.16.0] — 2026-03-14

### Added

- **REVIEW.md created during install** — `init-project` now generates `REVIEW.md` alongside `CLAUDE.md` so Anthropic's agentic reviewer has review instructions immediately after installation. Previously only created during `update-project` or `trw_deliver()`. Uses `_write_if_missing` so user edits are preserved on re-run.

## [0.15.2] — 2026-03-15

### Added

- **Installer UX overhaul** (PRD-CORE-083) — preflight section moves Python check and feature prompts before numbered steps so step count never jumps mid-flow. Config-level feature flags (`embeddings_enabled`, `sqlite_vec_enabled`) persist user choices across reinstalls. Consolidated extras into single step. Dynamic success banner adapts to fresh install vs reinstall. Random tip from 12-item curated pool.
- **Real backend health check** (PRD-CORE-083) — installer probes each configured `platform_url` via `urllib.request` against `/v1/health` with 5s timeout. Auto-detects local Docker backends via `docker-compose.yml` presence. Parallel probing via `ThreadPoolExecutor`. Replaces cosmetic "Connected" message that only checked API key format.
- **MCP server restart after upgrade** (PRD-INFRA-041) — version sentinel pattern (`.trw/installed-version.json`) written by installer, detected by `_check_version_sentinel()` during `trw_session_start()`. Injects `update_advisory` with both version numbers and `/mcp` instruction. HTTP-mode servers killed via PID file with cross-platform `_is_process_alive()` (ctypes on Windows, `os.kill(pid, 0)` on Unix).
- **CLAUDE.md sync timeout** (PRD-INFRA-041) — 30-second `ThreadPoolExecutor` timeout prevents installer hang when LLM initialization or network calls stall during CLAUDE.md rendering.
- **Cross-platform process management** — `_is_process_alive()` uses `ctypes.windll.kernel32.OpenProcess` on Windows (CPython issue #14480: `os.kill(pid, 0)` broken on Windows). `_terminate_process()` falls back to `taskkill /PID` on Windows.

### Fixed

- **Build check venv-first resolution** — `_find_executable()` now checks package venv → project venv → PATH (was PATH-first, finding system pytest without project dependencies). Also checks Windows `Scripts/` directory.
- **Build check pytest cwd** — `_run_pytest()` runs from `project_root` (where `tests/` lives), not `project_root/build_root` (where `src/` lives). Fixes "file or directory not found: tests/" error.
- **`_load_prior_config` UnicodeDecodeError** — now catches `UnicodeDecodeError` for binary config files.
- **`llm.py` unused type: ignore** — added `unused-ignore` to `import anthropic` suppression for mypy --strict.

### PRDs Completed

- **PRD-CORE-083**: Installer UX Overhaul and Backend Health Check (8 FRs, 32 tests)
- **PRD-INFRA-041**: Cross-Platform MCP Server Restart After Install (10 FRs, 45 tests)

## [0.15.1] — 2026-03-14

### Fixed

- **mypy --strict clean for trw-mcp** — resolved all 10 pre-existing type errors by widening `LearningEntryDict` → `dict[str, object]` in function signatures (`_recall.py`, `_decay.py`, `learning.py`, `ceremony.py`, `_ceremony_helpers.py`, `learning_injection.py`, `tiers.py`) and TypedDict fields (`_tools.py`). 0 errors across 156 files.
- **mypy --strict clean for trw-memory** — resolved all 13 pre-existing type errors: fixed `type: ignore` codes (`sqlite_backend.py`, `local.py`, `client.py`), widened formatter params to `Sequence[Mapping]` for TypedDict covariance (`cli_formatters.py`), added `_backend_or_raise` property for None safety (`llamaindex.py`). 0 errors across 77 files.
- **WSL2 filesystem learning marked obsolete** — environment migrated to native Ubuntu 24.04.

### Changed

- **Node.js 24 available** — installed via nvm for ESLint and platform build. `platform/package-lock.json` updated.

## [0.15.0] — 2026-03-14

### Added

- **Worktree pre-spawn safety** — FRAMEWORK.md, `trw-lead` agent, and `/trw-sprint-team` skill now mandate `git status --porcelain` before `git worktree add`. Blocks on uncommitted changes with user options (commit/stash/abort). Prevents agents from operating on stale committed state.
- **Test file ownership enforcement** — `test_owns` in `file_ownership.yaml` now follows the same zero-overlap rules as `owns`. FRAMEWORK.md, `trw-lead`, and `/trw-team-playbook` skill updated. Two agents editing the same test file caused 4 merge iterations in Sprint 66.
- **Adversarial audit enforcement** — `trw_review()` moved from Flexible to Rigid for STANDARD+ complexity tasks. `_ceremony_helpers.py` emits `review_warning` (not `review_advisory`) when review is missing on STANDARD/COMPREHENSIVE runs.
- **Ceremony recovery after compaction** — `trw_pre_compact_checkpoint` now reads `.trw/context/ceremony-state.json` and includes ceremony state + pending obligations in `pre_compact_state.json` and `compact_instructions.txt`.
- **Pre-implementation state verification** — `/trw-sprint-init` skill now greps the codebase for FR identifiers before sprint planning. Flags PRDs that are >80% already implemented as `LIKELY IMPLEMENTED`.
- **`_read_complexity_class()` helper** — extracted from `check_delivery_gates()` for testability
- **`_compute_pending_ceremony()` helper** — data-driven via `_CEREMONY_OBLIGATIONS` table, replaces 4 imperative if-blocks

### Changed

- **FRAMEWORK.md v24.3** — Worktree Safety subsection added to Agent Teams. File Ownership expanded to include test files. RIGID tool classification updated with `trw_review()` and worktree validation.
- **`trw-lead` agent** — File Ownership Enforcement and Worktree Pre-Spawn Validation sections added.
- **`/trw-sprint-team` skill** — Step 6a (Pre-Worktree State Validation) added before worktree creation.
- **`/trw-team-playbook` skill** — Zero-overlap validation expanded to cross-check `test_owns` across all teammates.
- **`/trw-sprint-init` skill** — Step 3 (Pre-implementation state check) added after PRD survey.

## [0.14.0] — 2026-03-14

### Added

- **MemoryStore connection singleton** (`state/memory_store.py`) — `get_memory_store()` / `reset_memory_store()` for connection reuse across warm tier operations (PRD-FIX-046-FR03)
- **Batch SQL access tracking** (`state/memory_adapter.py`) — `update_access_tracking()` uses single `UPDATE ... WHERE id IN (...)` instead of N per-ID operations (PRD-FIX-046-FR01)
- **Single-query keyword search** (`state/memory_adapter.py`) — `_keyword_search()` uses AND'd LIKE clauses in one SQL query for multi-token searches (PRD-FIX-046-FR02)
- **Shared ThreadPoolExecutor** (`clients/llm.py`) — module-level `_get_executor()` replaces per-call pool creation (PRD-FIX-046-FR05)
- **PRD template v2.2** — FIX/RESEARCH category variant sections (Root Cause Analysis, Rollback Plan, Background & Prior Art, etc.), FR Status annotations, category-aware Quality Checklist
- **`_filter_sections_for_category()` trailing content fix** — Appendix and Quality Checklist preserved for all categories
- **FIX-043 tests** — FR02 (unique ceremony event names via AST), FR03 (flush queue preservation), FR07 (mark_run_complete warning)
- **FIX-044 tests** — module-level capture verification, submodule function-level config checks
- **MemoryStore singleton tests** — same-path reuse, different-path recreation, reset cleanup

### Changed

- **Error handling policy enforced** (PRD-FIX-043) — all `except Exception` blocks now either log at `warning+` with `exc_info=True` or have `# justified: <reason>` comments. Zero non-compliant blocks remain.
- **Module-level config capture eliminated** (PRD-FIX-044) — zero `_config = get_config()` or `_reader`/`_writer` module-scope assignments remain. `claude_md` submodules use function-level `get_config()` / `FileStateReader()` / `FileStateWriter()`.
- **`scoring/__init__.py`** — `sys.modules` replacement hack removed, standard `__getattr__` shim
- **DRY glob consolidation** (PRD-FIX-045) — zero raw `entries_dir.glob("*.yaml")` patterns remain; all use `iter_yaml_entry_files()` from `state/_helpers.py`
- **`_safe_float`/`_safe_int` aliases removed** from `analytics/core.py` — consumers import directly from `state._helpers`
- **`trw-prd-groom` skill** — updated from V1 "0.85 completeness" to V2 "total_score >= 65 (REVIEW tier)"
- **`_reset_module_singletons` fixture** — removed (no longer needed)
- **`__reload_hook__` functions** — removed from modules that only reset singletons

### Fixed

- **`_correlation.py` YAML path lookup** — used `yaml_find_entry_by_id()` instead of broken `{lid}.yaml` pattern (YAML files use date-slug names)
- **`memory_adapter.py` `outcome_history` field** — added to `_memory_to_learning_dict()` output for SQLite-based reads
- **Template filter dropping Appendix** — `_filter_sections_for_category()` now extracts trailing non-numbered sections and preserves them

## [0.13.3] — 2026-03-14

### Fixed

- **Telemetry events table empty on dashboard** (P0) — `getTelemetryEvents()` in `platform/src/lib/api.ts` expected a flat array but the backend returns a `PaginatedResponse` envelope. Now unwraps `.items` from the paginated response.
- **`tests_passed: true` despite test failures** (P0) — `_run_pytest()` in `build/_runners.py` set `tests_passed` based only on pytest's return code, ignoring parsed `failure_count`. Now cross-checks `result.returncode == 0 and failure_count == 0` on both standard and custom command paths.
- **`build_pass_rate` always null on analytics dashboard** (P1) — `pytest_passed`, `test_count`, `coverage_pct`, `mypy_passed` fields were not in `_MAPPED_FIELDS` in `backend/routers/telemetry.py`, so they fell into the `payload` JSON overflow bucket instead of their dedicated DB columns. Added `_bool()` helper and mapped all four fields.
- **`trw_quality_dashboard` trends always null** (P1) — `dashboard.py:aggregate_dashboard()` reads `ceremony_score`, `coverage_pct`, `tests_passed` from `session-events.jsonl`, but no delivery step wrote those fields. Added session summary event in `_step_telemetry` that writes ceremony score, task, phase, and build results to `session-events.jsonl`.
- **`config.telemetry` gate always truthy** (P2) — the `if config.telemetry:` check in `tools/telemetry.py` tested a `TelemetryConfig` Pydantic object (always truthy). Changed to check `config.telemetry.platform_telemetry_enabled` for proper two-tier gating of detailed telemetry records.

## [0.13.2] — 2026-03-14

### Fixed

- **Build check timeout indistinguishable from failure** — `trw_build_check` subprocess timeouts wrote `tests_passed: false` to `build-status.yaml`, identical to actual test failures. Added `timed_out: bool` field to `BuildStatus` model, `PytestResultDict`, and `MypyResultDict`. The deliver gate hook now differentiates timeout from failure with distinct error messages.
- **Deliver gate hook error messages lack motivation** — rewrote all 3 hook error paths (no build record, timeout, failure) with structured BLOCKED/WHY/ACTION format. Messages now explain *why* the gate exists (protect the user from broken code) and provide copy-pasteable next steps, including an escape hatch for timeouts when tests were verified manually.

### Changed

- **`BuildStatus` model** — added `timed_out` field (default `false`), propagated through `_runners.py` → `_core.py` → `_registration.py`.
- **`pre-tool-deliver-gate.sh`** — both `.claude/hooks/` and bundled `data/hooks/` copies updated with prompt-engineered error messages.

## [0.13.1] — 2026-03-14

### Added

- **AARE-F scoring truthfulness** (PRD-FIX-054) — removed 3 stub dimensions (`smell_score`, `readability`, `ears_coverage`) from V2 scorer output. Implemented `_compute_ambiguity_rate()` with pre-compiled regexes for vague term detection. Recalibrated dimension weights to sum to 100 across 3 active dimensions (density=42, structure=25, traceability=33). Risk profiles updated to 3-tuple weights.
- **Language-agnostic traceability** (PRD-FIX-055) — `test_refs` regex now matches TypeScript `.test.ts`/`.spec.tsx`, Go `_test.go`, Java `*Test.java`, Ruby `_spec.rb`, and Rust conventions. 58 new tests verify all language conventions.
- **PRD status integrity** (PRD-FIX-056) — status drift detection compares YAML frontmatter vs prose Quick Reference. `update_frontmatter()` auto-syncs prose status. `prd_status.py` state machine wired into `check_transition_guards()`. FR-level `**Status**: active` annotation injected into generated templates. Warns on null `approved_by` for terminal transitions.
- **Category-specific template variants** (PRD-CORE-080) — `template_variants.py` defines 4 template variants (feature=12 sections, fix=7, infra=9, research=3). `score_structural_completeness()` now category-aware. `_generate_prd_body()` filters sections by category. Content density section weights configurable via `TRWConfig`. Decorative fields (`aaref_components`, `conflicts_with`) stripped from generated PRDs.
- **TypedDict type system** — 79 TypedDict classes across 18 submodules in `models/typed_dicts/` replacing `dict[str, object]` at all major cross-module boundaries. Includes `StepResultBase` and `ReviewResultBase` inheritance hierarchies. Applied to 30+ source files (memory_adapter, tools/, scoring/, state/, build/, review/, ceremony/).
- **~225 new Sprint 63 tests** — covering scoring truthfulness, traceability language support, status integrity, template variants.

### Fixed

- **Scoring total_score unreachable** — ceiling was 76-78 due to stub dimensions inflating the denominator. Now achievable up to 100.
- **Non-Python PRDs penalized** — TypeScript/Go/Rust PRDs lost 6-8 traceability points from Python-only `test_refs` regex.
- **Ambiguity rate always 0.0** — was hardcoded; now computed from vague term count / requirement statement count.
- **Q-value convergence broken** — `process_outcome()` read from SQLite but wrote only to YAML. Subsequent calls got stale data. Fixed with SQLite writeback after Q-value computation.
- **Status drift undetected** — no mechanism compared frontmatter status vs prose Quick Reference. Now warns on mismatch.
- **32 pre-existing test failures** — root cause: `_isolate_trw_dir` fixture path mismatch between `isolated_project/.trw/` and `tmp_path/.trw/`. Fixed project root resolution consistency.
- **`PublishResult` duplicate** — was identical to `PublishLearningsResult`; now an alias.

### Changed

- **Dimension weights** — `validation_density_weight=42.0`, `validation_structure_weight=25.0`, `validation_traceability_weight=33.0` (previously 25/15/20 out of 60 active).
- **Risk profile weights** — all 4 profiles changed from 6-tuple to 3-tuple (density, structure, traceability).
- **Stub config fields marked reserved** — `validation_smell_weight`, `validation_readability_weight`, `validation_ears_weight`, `consistency_validation_min` annotated as "reserved — not enforced".
- **`completeness_score` deprecated** — field retained for backward compatibility with deprecation annotation; `total_score` is the sole authoritative metric.
- **`typed_dicts.py` modularized** — 1,424-line monolith split into 18 focused submodules with backward-compatible re-exports via `__init__.py`.

## [0.13.0] — 2026-03-14

### Added

- **Test isolation autouse fixture** (PRD-FIX-050-FR01/FR02) — prevents pytest runs from polluting production `.trw/context/` analytics files. Patches `resolve_trw_dir()` and `resolve_project_root()` across all late-import consumers.
- **Ceremony scoring reads session-events.jsonl** (PRD-FIX-051-FR01/FR05) — `compute_ceremony_score()` now merges events from both run-level `events.jsonl` and the fallback `session-events.jsonl`, fixing scores that were always 0.0 because `trw_session_start` fires before `trw_init`.
- **Zero-score escalation guard** (PRD-FIX-051-FR04) — `check_auto_escalation()` returns `None` when all scores are 0.0 (corrupted data), preventing spurious STANDARD→COMPREHENSIVE escalations.
- **De-escalation wiring** (PRD-FIX-051-FR03) — ceremony reduction proposals are now generated during delivery and persisted to `ceremony-overrides.yaml` on disk (thread-safe across daemon/main threads).
- **Task description pass-through** (PRD-FIX-051-FR06) — `classify_task_class()` now accepts `task_description` parameter, using objective keywords for more accurate classification beyond task name alone.
- **Impact tier auto-assignment** (PRD-FIX-052-FR01/FR02) — `assign_impact_tiers()` labels entries as `critical/high/medium/low` based on impact score. Uses `Literal` type enforcement on `LearningEntry.impact_tier`.
- **Tag-based consolidation fallback** (PRD-FIX-052-FR03) — when embeddings are unavailable, consolidation uses Jaccard similarity on tag overlap (no `max_entries` cap for the tag path).
- **Auto-obsolete on compendium** (PRD-FIX-052-FR04) — when `consolidated_from` is provided to `trw_learn`, source entries are automatically marked obsolete.
- **Pattern tag auto-suggestion** (PRD-FIX-052-FR05) — heuristic keyword detection adds `"pattern"` tag to solution-oriented learnings (e.g., "use X instead of Y").
- **Tier distribution in deliver results** (PRD-FIX-052-FR07) — delivery output now includes `impact_tier_distribution` counts.
- **Embedding health advisory** (PRD-FIX-053-FR01/FR07) — `trw_session_start` response includes `embed_health` dict with `enabled`, `available`, `advisory`, and `recent_failures` fields.
- **Relaxed trust increment** (PRD-FIX-053-FR02) — trust fires on "productive session" (≥3 learnings + ≥1 checkpoint) even without `build_check`, reading both event files.
- **claude_md_sync content hash** (PRD-FIX-053-FR04) — SHA-256 hash of inputs skips redundant 50-second renders when nothing changed.
- **BFS PRD auto-progression** (PRD-FIX-053-FR05) — `auto_progress_prds` uses BFS to find valid multi-step transition paths, stopping at first guard failure instead of returning `invalid_transition`.
- **Telemetry event separation** (PRD-FIX-053-FR06) — `suppress_internal_events()` context manager via `contextvars` suppresses bookkeeping events (`jsonl_appended`, `yaml_written`, `vector_upserted`) from telemetry logs.
- **SQLite outcome correlation** (PRD-FIX-053-FR03) — O(1) indexed lookup via `memory_adapter` with YAML fallback for pre-migration entries.
- **~111 new tests** — zero regressions, +88 net new passing tests vs baseline.

### Fixed

- **Ceremony scoring always 0.0** — root cause: `trw_session_start` event written to `session-events.jsonl` (fallback path) was never read by scoring function.
- **Task classification always "documentation"** — root cause: `run_state.get("task_name")` used wrong field key (`task_name` vs `task` in RunState model).
- **Auto-escalation one-way ratchet** — zero-score guard + de-escalation proposal wiring.
- **outcome_quality hardcoded 0.6** — now derived from build_passed, coverage_delta, critical_findings, mutation_score.
- **agent_id always "unknown"** — derived from `TRW_AGENT_ID` env, run_id, or `pid-{N}`.
- **sessions_count always 0** — migrated to `sessions_tracked` (session_start) + `sessions_delivered` (deliver) split.
- **Test-polluted production data** — `sanitize_ceremony_feedback()` one-time migration removes pytest entries.
- **Publish threshold too restrictive** — `min_impact` lowered from 0.7 to 0.5.
- **"add" keyword too broad** in task classification — replaced with "add feature".

### Changed

- **`_merge_session_events()` DRY helper** — extracted shared session-events.jsonl merge logic used by both ceremony scoring and trust increment.
- **`scan_all_runs` passes `trw_dir`** to `compute_ceremony_score` for accurate analytics reports.
- **Consolidation `max_entries` cap removed** for tag-based fallback path (cap was for embedding API costs, irrelevant for local tag comparison).

## [0.12.7] — 2026-03-14

### Changed

- **trw-implementer agent upgraded to Opus** — changed model from `claude-sonnet-4-6` to `claude-opus-4-6` for higher-quality implementation output.

## [0.12.6] — 2026-03-14

### Added

- **Skills v2 frontmatter migration** (PRD-INFRA-037) — all 24 skills now declare `model` (8 opus, 16 sonnet), 5 destructive skills have `disable-model-invocation: true`, 7 read-only skills use `context: fork`, 4 PLAN-phase skills include `ultrathink` for deep reasoning.
- **PreToolUse deliver gate** (PRD-INFRA-038) — new `pre-tool-deliver-gate.sh` blocks `trw_deliver()` unless `build-status.yaml` shows `tests_passed: true`. Fail-open pattern with actionable error messages.
- **SubagentStop telemetry** (PRD-INFRA-038) — new `subagent-stop.sh` hook emits structured JSONL to `.trw/logs/subagent-events.jsonl` for paired start/stop lifecycle tracking.
- **SubagentStart telemetry** (PRD-INFRA-038) — enhanced `subagent-start.sh` with matching JSONL telemetry for paired analysis.
- **Path-scoped rules** (PRD-INFRA-039) — 3 new `.claude/rules/` files (`backend-python.md`, `platform-tsx.md`, `trw-mcp-python.md`) that only load when Claude touches matching files, reducing per-session token consumption.
- **Plugin packaging** (PRD-INFRA-040) — `make plugin` builds a Claude Code plugin directory with all skills, agents, hooks, and MCP config. Testable via `claude --plugin-dir build/trw-plugin`.
- **Plugin manifest** — `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` with `minClaudeCodeVersion: 2.1.32`, CC-BY-NC-SA-4.0 license.
- **Plugin hooks.json** — all 11 hook events registered with `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` path resolution.

### Changed

- **CLAUDE.md slimmed** — 337 → 181 lines by extracting package-specific content into path-scoped rules. Restored missing deployment commands, release workflow details, and `opusplan` note.
- **data/settings.json** — added PreToolUse (deliver gate) and SubagentStop hook registrations to the bootstrap template so new projects get them automatically.
- **Timestamp key standardized** — all hook JSONL output now uses `"ts"` key (matching lib-trw.sh `append_event` convention), replacing inconsistent `"timestamp"` usage.
- **pre-compact.sh enhanced** — captures wave_manifest, active_tasks, and pending_decisions in the pre-compaction state snapshot for better recovery.
- **pre-compact.sh no-jq fallback** — simplified to emit minimal JSON without user-controlled strings to prevent injection in degraded mode.
- **Framework version** — updated reference in CLAUDE.md from v24.2 to v24.3 to match TRWConfig source of truth.
- **trw-simplify SKILL.md** — fixed non-standard `allowed_tools` (underscore) to `allowed-tools` (hyphen), added missing `name`, `description`, `user-invocable` fields.
- **trw-dry-check SKILL.md** — added missing `user-invocable`, `allowed-tools`, `argument-hint`, `description` fields.

### Documentation

- **3 research documents** — `skills-v2-reference.md` (complete Skills v2 spec), `claude-code-march-2026-updates.md` (hooks, MCP, settings), `prompting-claude-4-6.md` (anti-overtriggering, adaptive thinking).
- **Agent Teams prerequisite** — documented `CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS=1` env var requirement in CLAUDE.md.
- **MCP Tool Search** — documented `ENABLE_TOOL_SEARCH` env var and auto-deferral threshold.
- **Worktree isolation exclusion** — documented rationale for not adopting `isolation: worktree` on agents.

## [0.12.5] — 2026-03-13

### Fixed

- **Auth error leaks into installer progress** — `_run_claude_md_sync` now suppresses stdout/stderr during LLMClient initialization and CLAUDE.md sync. Prevents `TypeError: "Could not resolve authentication"` from corrupting the installer's spinner output when no Anthropic API key is configured.
- **Installer regex matched Python exceptions** — `re.search(r"Error")` matched `TypeError`, `ValueError`, etc. Changed to `re.match()` with line-start anchoring so only progress-format lines (e.g., `Error: path`) are parsed.

### Added

- **2 tests for CLAUDE.md sync auth failure** — verifies auth errors are captured as warnings (not errors) and don't leak to stdout.

## [0.12.4] — 2026-03-13

### Fixed

- **Installer progress stalls at "70 files"** — the spinner stopped updating during slow post-file phases (cleanup, verification, CLAUDE.md sync). Now emits `Phase:` progress lines for all 7 update stages, and the installer parses them to update the spinner message (e.g., "Updating project... (70 files) Syncing CLAUDE.md...").
- **Installer regex missed `Skipped`/`Error` progress lines** — expanded `run_with_progress` regex to match all action types from the progress callback.

## [0.12.3] — 2026-03-13

### Added

- **Streaming progress output** — `init-project` and `update-project` now emit file-by-file progress lines to stdout in real time via `ProgressCallback`. The installer's spinner updates live (e.g., "Updating project... (23 files) .claude/hooks/pre-compact.sh") instead of showing a static "Updating project..." for the entire duration.

### Changed

- **Installer re-run UX** — removed unnecessary "Change project name?" prompt on re-install. Prior project name, API key, and telemetry settings are now silently reused without confirmation prompts.

## [0.12.2] — 2026-03-13

### Changed

- **Memory audit/optimize skills** — replaced hardcoded "20-40 entries" target with dynamic sizing formula: (domain count) × 3-5 per domain. Adds consolidation depth limits (max 10-15 per compendium), domain coverage rules, and sub-topic granularity constraints. Prevents over-aggressive consolidation on large multi-domain projects.

## [0.12.1] — 2026-03-13

### Added

- **Installer re-run intelligence** — when re-run in a directory with an existing TRW installation, the installer now:
  - Reads prior settings from `.trw/config.yaml` (project name, API key, telemetry preferences)
  - Detects already-installed optional extras (`anthropic`, `sqlite-vec`) via import probes
  - Skips questions whose answers are already known, showing "reusing prior settings" feedback
  - Skips IDE detection prompt when IDEs are already configured

### Changed

- **Version bump** — minor version bump reflecting multi-IDE support (PRD-CORE-074: OpenCode, Cursor, Layer 3 nudges)

## [0.11.7] — 2026-03-13

### Added

- **Multi-IDE support (PRD-CORE-074)** — OpenCode, Cursor, and future CLIs now supported alongside Claude Code
  - IDE detection (`detect_ide`, `detect_installed_clis`, `resolve_ide_targets`)
  - OpenCode bootstrap: `opencode.json` + `AGENTS.md` with smart merge
  - Cursor bootstrap: `hooks.json` (4 events), `.cursor/rules/*.mdc`, `mcp.json` with smart merge
  - `--ide` flag on `init-project` / `update-project` CLI commands
  - Installer CLI detection with interactive opt-in prompt
- **Layer 3 MCP Cooperative Nudges** — ceremony status in every `trw_*` tool response with progressive urgency (low→medium→high)
  - `ceremony_nudge.py` — state tracker with atomic file persistence
  - Wired into all production tools (session_start, checkpoint, deliver, build_check, learn)
  - `compute_nudge_minimal()` for local models (≤200 chars)
- **Instructions sync** — `trw_claude_md_sync` gains `client` param (auto/claude-code/opencode/all), writes to CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md, or both
- **IDE adapter hook** (`lib-ide-adapter.sh`) — routes ceremony enforcement across IDE variants
- **+68 bootstrap tests** — `_write_version_yaml`, `_result_action_key`, OpenCode, Cursor, enforcement variants

### Changed

- **Bootstrap refactor** — extracted `_result_action_key()` helper (DRY, replaces 4 inline copies), added structured logging to `_write_version_yaml`, type annotation fix for mypy `--strict`

## [0.11.6] — 2026-03-13

### Changed

- **PRD pipeline consolidation** — `/trw-prd-groom`, `/trw-prd-review`, and `/trw-exec-plan` are now internal phases, no longer user-invocable. New `/trw-prd-ready` skill orchestrates the full pipeline (groom → review → exec plan) in one command. `/trw-prd-new` auto-chains into the full pipeline after creation.
- **Framework v24.3** — updated lifecycle, skill table, and PRD lifecycle documentation to reflect consolidated pipeline
- **Skill prompt quality** — added 0.70 floor gate to groom phase, `trw_learn` call to exec-plan, conditional advisory in review phase, explicit delegation model per pipeline phase
- **Version DRY** — centralized version management: `TRWConfig` is single source of truth for framework/AARE-F versions, `pyproject.toml` for package versions. Tests derive versions from config instead of hardcoding. Bootstrap generates `VERSION.yaml` dynamically via `importlib.metadata`. `trw-memory/_version.py` also uses `importlib.metadata`.
- **AARE-F version** — corrected `aaref_version` default from `v1.1.0` to `v2.0.0` (matching the actual document header)

## [0.11.5] — 2026-03-13

### Removed

- **Bash installer** (`install-trw.template.sh`) — redundant with the Python installer which the site recommends; removed template, build format option, and bash-specific codepath from `build_installer.py`
- **`mcp-hmr` dev dependency** — incompatible with `fastmcp>=3.0` (requires `fastmcp<3`); removed from `[dev]` extras

### Fixed

- **Missing dev dependencies** — added `hypothesis`, `sqlite-vec`, and `rank-bm25` to `[dev]` extras so fresh venvs pass the full test suite

### Added — Code Quality & Test Coverage Hardening

- **710 new tests across the monorepo** — trw-mcp +599 (3,927→4,526), backend +112 (725→837), trw-memory assertions strengthened (29 weak assertions replaced)
- **12 new test files** covering previously untested modules:
  - `test_scoring_edge_cases.py` (99 tests) — decay, correlation, complexity, recall algorithms
  - `test_prd_utils_edge.py` (83 tests) — frontmatter parsing, sections, content density, transitions
  - `test_memory_adapter_edge.py` (56 tests) — embed, convert, recall, store, reset paths
  - `test_knowledge_topology_edge.py` (53 tests) — jaccard, clusters, merge, render functions
  - `test_persistence_edge.py` (49 tests) — YAML roundtrip, locks, concurrency, events
  - `test_learning_injection_edge.py` (29 tests) — domain tags, selection, formatting
  - `test_recall_tracking_edge.py` (14 tests) — outcome recording, stats edge cases
  - Backend: `test_admin_orgs.py` (33), `test_admin_users.py` (17), `test_admin_keys.py` (13), `test_edge_cases.py` (11)
- **Modules at 100% coverage** — `recall_tracking.py`, `auto_upgrade.py`
- **Expanded existing test files** — +45 consolidation, +37 validation gates, +33 semantic checks, +31 dashboard, +26 auto_upgrade, +23 tiers, +22 export, +29 backend SSE/telemetry

### Changed

- **`consolidation.py`** — function parameters changed from `list[dict[str, object]]` to `Sequence[dict[str, object]]` for Pyright covariance compatibility
- **`_update_project.py`** — extracted `_coerce_manifest_list()`, `_remove_stale_set()`, `_migrate_predecessor_set()` DRY helpers reducing ~90 lines of duplication
- **`sqlite_backend.py` (trw-memory)** — extracted `_build_filter_clause()` static method eliminating WHERE clause duplication between `search()` and `list_entries()`
- **`learning.py`, `requirements.py`** — consolidated scattered imports from same modules into single blocks
- **Backend `test_config.py`** — properly typed `_reload_config()` return as `BackendConfig`, removing 13 `type: ignore[attr-defined]`
- **Backend `auth_2fa.py`** — bare `dict` changed to `dict[str, Any]` for PyJWT payloads, removing 2 `type: ignore[type-arg]`
- **Backend test files** — added proper `TestClient` and `Session` type annotations, removing 6 `type: ignore[no-untyped-def]`
- **Platform `VariationH.tsx`** — added `role="button"`, `tabIndex={0}`, `onKeyDown` to 6 interactive `<div>` elements for keyboard accessibility
- **Platform `login/route.ts`** — added error logging to 3 silent catch blocks

### Fixed

- **trw-memory weak assertions** — replaced 29 instances of `assert x is True/False` with idiomatic `assert x` / `assert not x` across 11 test files

---

### Added — Sprint 56: Agent Quality & Review Gaps

- **Context-aware learning injection** (`state/learning_injection.py`) — `select_learnings_for_task()` ranks recall results by 60% tag overlap + 40% impact score; `infer_domain_tags()` maps path components to domain tags; `format_learning_injection()` renders markdown for prompt prepending
- **N-gram DRY enforcement** (`state/dry_check.py`) — sliding-window SHA-256 duplication detector with configurable block size and boilerplate filtering
- **Migration verification gate** (`state/phase_gates_build.py`) — detects model-without-migration gaps and NOT NULL columns without `server_default`
- **Semantic review automation** (`state/semantic_checks.py` + `data/semantic_checks.yaml`) — 10 regex-based semantic checks (6 automated, 4 manual) with language-aware filtering
- **`trw-dry-check` skill** — on-demand duplication scanning via `/trw-dry-check`
- **VALIDATE soft gates** — DRY, migration, and semantic checks wired into `_check_validate_exit()` as best-effort warnings
- **Agent prompt updates** — `trw-implementer.md` DRY checklist, `trw-reviewer.md` semantic rubric, `trw-team-playbook` learning injection
- **Config fields** — `migration_gate_enabled`, `dry_check_enabled`, `dry_check_min_block_size`, `agent_learning_injection`, `agent_learning_max`, `agent_learning_min_impact`, `semantic_checks_enabled`
- **109 new tests** — migration gate (26), DRY check (19), learning injection (30), semantic checks (34)

---

## [0.11.4] — 2026-03-10

### Fixed — Silent MCP Startup Crashes

- **Crash log on startup failure** — `__main__.py` wraps the entire startup in try/except, writes crash details to `.trw/logs/crash.log` AND stderr so failures are always visible
- **Early stderr logging** — `main()` configures basic logging before config/middleware loads, so exceptions during initialization are no longer invisible
- **Defensive middleware init** — `_build_middleware()` and `_load_server_instructions()` catch exceptions instead of crashing the import chain
- **Correct Python path in `.mcp.json`** — uses `sys.executable` (absolute path) instead of bare `python` which doesn't exist on many systems
- **Resilient message loading** — `get_message_or_default()` catches all exceptions (not just KeyError/FileNotFoundError), so missing `ruamel.yaml` doesn't kill the server

### Added

- **CLAUDE.md deployment docs** — release workflow, migration fallback, API key scopes, PostgreSQL JSON cast gotchas

---

## [0.11.3] — 2026-03-09

### Added

- **Background batch send on session start** — `trw_session_start()` now fires a daemon-thread batch send after flushing telemetry events, so new installations appear in the dashboard immediately instead of waiting for `trw_deliver()`
- **Admin installations endpoint** — `GET /admin/installations` shows all installations across all orgs (platform admin only)
- **Admin-aware installations dashboard** — admin users see all installations with org column; non-admin users see org-scoped view

### Changed — Installer Rewrite (Bash → Python)

- **Installer rewritten from bash to Python** — `install-trw.template.py` replaces `install-trw.template.sh` as the default installer format. Users now run `python3 install-trw.py` instead of `bash install-trw.sh`.
- **Box alignment fixed permanently** — `draw_box()` uses ANSI-aware `_visible_len()` + f-string padding
- **Smart color detection** — ANSI colors auto-disable when stdout is not a TTY
- **Phased architecture** — each installation step is a standalone function for maintainability
- **Threaded spinner** — replaces bash background subshell + PID juggling with a clean daemon thread
- **`build_installer.py`** — now supports `--format py|sh` (Python is default)

### Fixed

- **API key scopes on waitlist conversion** — converted users now get `scopes=["*"]` instead of empty scopes, fixing 401 errors on all scope-protected endpoints
- **API key scopes on admin key creation** — same fix for `POST /admin/organizations/{org_id}/api-keys`
- **Header stats format corruption** — split `_build_stats_summary` into separate index/roadmap formatters
- **Index sync double write** — consolidated to single read→merge→update→write
- **Sprint-finish step ordering** — PRD status update moved after build gate passes
- **FD leak** — `_try_acquire_deferred_lock` exception handler widened
- **Deploy script** — `.trw/` excluded from uncommitted changes check; `python` → `python3` for WSL2

---

## [0.11.2] — 2026-03-07

### Fixed — Installer Progress Feedback

- **Live progress during project setup** — spinner now updates with file-by-file progress (`Updating project... (12 files) CLAUDE.md`) instead of a static "Updating existing installation..." message that appeared frozen
- **`run_with_progress()` helper** — streams command output in background, parses Updated/Created/Preserved lines, and updates spinner message in real time
- **`update_spinner()` function** — allows dynamic spinner message updates via shared temp file
- Script mode shows prefixed output directly instead of suppressing it

---

## [0.11.1] — 2026-03-07

### Improved — Interactive Installer

- **Interactive mode** — installer detects terminal and shows spinner animations, progress steps, and box-drawing banners
- **Optional feature prompts** — interactive mode prompts for AI/LLM extras (`trw-mcp[ai]`) and `sqlite-vec` installation
- **New CLI flags** — `--ai`, `--no-ai`, `--sqlite-vec`, `--no-sqlite-vec`, `--quiet`, `--script` for headless automation
- **DRY pip install** — extracted `pip_install()` helper for the 3-tier fallback pattern (normal → `--user` → `--break-system-packages`)
- **Cleaner update output** — `update-project` output captured with spinner overlay instead of raw structlog debug spam
- **Script mode preserved** — piped input or `--script` flag gives the same quiet output as before

### Fixed — Production Deployment

- **NextAuth 500 on Amplify** — env vars (`AUTH_SECRET`, `NEXTAUTH_SECRET`) not reaching Next.js standalone runtime; fixed by baking them via `next.config.ts` `env{}` block
- **Backend 500 on telemetry** — migration 0009 (token columns) never applied to production Lambda; added auto-migration step to `deploy.sh`
- **Installer endpoint** — `/releases/latest/installer` was redirecting to `.zip` artifact instead of `install-trw.sh`; fixed S3 key derivation
- **Version sync** — pyproject.toml version synced with CHANGELOG (was stuck at 0.4.0)

---

## [0.11.0] — 2026-03-08

### Fixed — Framework Optimization Audit

- **Session duration tracking** — `_step_telemetry()` computes `total_duration_ms` from earliest `session_start` event timestamp; was always 0
- **Stop hook false positives** — `trw_deliver()` logs `trw_deliver_complete` to fallback `session-events.jsonl` when no active run; hook checks both locations
- **Review confidence scale mismatch** — normalize 0.0-1.0 confidence to 0-100 before comparing against `review_confidence_threshold`; was silently filtering 90%+ confidence findings
- **Silent exception handlers** — 15 `except Exception: pass` in tools/ replaced with `logger.debug(event, exc_info=True)`; fail-open preserved

### Added

- **Untracked source file detection** — `check_delivery_gates()` warns about uncommitted `.py`/`.ts`/`.tsx` files in `src/`/`tests/` before delivery
- **Cross-shard DRY review** — integration reviewer prompt and `trw-reviewer.md` agent include DRY violation detection and spec-based test gap analysis
- **Spec-based test review** — `trw-review-pr` skill and `reviewer-test-quality.md` expanded with acceptance-criterion verification checklist

---

## [0.10.0] — 2026-03-04

### Architecture — DRY Consolidation & God Module Decomposition (Sprint 54)

#### P0 — Cross-Package DRY Elimination

- **`scoring.py` consolidated** — 9 pure math functions (`update_q_value`, `compute_utility_score`,
  `apply_time_decay`, `bayesian_calibrate`, `compute_calibration_accuracy`, `_clamp01`, `_ensure_utc`,
  `_float_field`, `_int_field`) now imported from `trw_memory.lifecycle.scoring` instead of duplicated
  locally. Remaining trw-mcp-specific functions (different field names/signatures) kept local.
  `_float_field`/`_int_field` replaced by `safe_float`/`safe_int` from `_helpers.py` in local code.

- **`cosine_similarity` unified** — 3 copies → 1. `trw-mcp/state/dedup.py` now imports from
  `trw_memory.retrieval.dense`. Backend copy kept with TODO (no trw-memory dependency yet).

- **`analytics.py` decomposed** (1451→150 lines) into 4 focused modules:
  - `analytics_core.py` — singletons, constants, shared helpers, `__reload_hook__()`
  - `analytics_entries.py` — entry persistence, index management, extraction
  - `analytics_counters.py` — analytics.yaml counter updates, event pattern detection
  - `analytics_dedup.py` — deduplication, pruning, reflection quality scoring
  - `analytics.py` retained as backward-compatible re-export facade

#### P1 — Structural Consolidation

- **`tiers.py`** — `TierSweepResult` now imported from `trw_memory.lifecycle.tiers` (canonical source)
- **`consolidation.py`** — `_redact_paths`, `_parse_consolidation_response`, and clustering algorithm
  (`complete_linkage_cluster`) extracted to trw-memory, imported by trw-mcp (-55 lines)
- **`server.py:main()` split** (315→23 lines) into 7 extracted functions:
  `_build_arg_parser()`, `_SUBCOMMAND_HANDLERS` dispatch table, `_resolve_and_run_transport()`,
  `_run_http_proxy_transport()`, `_clean_stale_pid()`, `_spawn_http_server()`, `_wait_for_port()`

#### P2 — Quality of Life

- **`build.py` audit DRY** — extracted `_run_audit_tool()` shared helper from `_run_pip_audit`/`_run_npm_audit`
- **`scoring.py` helpers** — replaced `_float_field`/`_int_field` with `safe_float`/`safe_int` from `_helpers.py`
- **`bootstrap.py` decomposed** — `init_project()` (142→40 lines) with 7 extracted helpers,
  `_update_framework_files()` with 6 extracted helpers and shared `_update_or_report()` DRY function

---

## [0.9.0] — 2026-03-03

### Architecture — God Module Decomposition

- **`validation.py` split** (2089→146 lines) into 7 focused modules:
  - `risk_profiles.py` — risk level derivation and scaling
  - `event_helpers.py` — shared event I/O (single source of truth, eliminates duplication with `_phase_validators.py`)
  - `contract_validation.py` — wave contract validation protocol
  - `phase_gates.py` — phase exit/input criteria and enforcement
  - `prd_quality.py` — PRD quality scoring (V1 + V2)
  - `prd_progression.py` — auto-progression and status mapping
  - `integration_check.py` — tool registration and test coverage checks
  - `validation.py` retained as backward-compatible re-export facade

- **`phase_gates.py` split** (801→491 lines) into 3 modules:
  - `phase_gates_prd.py` — PRD enforcement gate (`_check_prd_enforcement`)
  - `phase_gates_build.py` — build status and integration check wrappers
  - `phase_gates.py` — main orchestrator with public API re-exports

### Fixed

- **Confidence threshold bug** — `handle_auto_mode` used `config.confidence_threshold` (float 0-1.0, INFRA-028) instead of `config.review_confidence_threshold` (int 0-100, QUAL-027), making auto-review filtering ineffective
- **8 flaky learning tests** — module-level singleton caching in `analytics.py` and `tools/learning.py` caused order-dependent failures; added `__reload_hook__()` and conftest autouse fixture `_reset_module_singletons`
- **`build.py` trivial wrappers** — removed `_cache_dep_audit` and `_cache_api_fuzz`, callers use `_cache_to_context` directly with `_DEP_AUDIT_FILE`/`_API_FUZZ_FILE` constants

### Improved

- **25 silent exception handlers** upgraded with `logger.debug("event_name", exc_info=True)` across 6 files: `analytics.py`, `orchestration.py`, `ceremony.py`, `_ceremony_helpers.py`, `learning.py`, `_phase_validators.py`
- **trw-memory shared utilities** — `storage/_parsing.py` with `parse_dt`, `parse_json_list`, `parse_json_dict_str`, `parse_json_dict_int`; replaces duplicated parsing in `sqlite_backend.py` and `yaml_backend.py`; fixes subtle UTC normalization bug in yaml_backend

### Stats
- 3632+ tests passing, mypy --strict clean on 88 files (trw-mcp) + 75 files (trw-memory)
- 11 new modules, 155 files changed, +1311 / -2455 lines

---

## [0.8.0] — 2026-03-02

### Added — Codebase Health & Architecture Improvements

- **7 new source modules** extracted for single-responsibility:
  - `state/phase.py` — phase validation and transition logic
  - `state/_phase_validators.py` — per-phase validation rules
  - `state/_helpers.py` — shared state utilities
  - `tools/_ceremony_helpers.py` — ceremony tool pure functions
  - `tools/_learning_helpers.py` — learning tool pure functions with `LearningParams` dataclass
  - `tools/_review_helpers.py` — review tool pure functions
  - `tools/mutations.py` — mutation testing, dependency audit, and API fuzz scopes

- **15 new test files** (+470 tests) covering extracted modules and edge paths:
  - `test_phase.py`, `test_phase_validators.py`, `test_state_helpers.py`
  - `test_ceremony_helpers.py`, `test_learning_helpers.py`, `test_review_helpers.py`
  - `test_mutations.py`, `test_build_edge_paths.py`, `test_review_modes.py`
  - `test_analytics_coverage_v2.py`, `test_tiers_coverage.py`, `test_recall_search.py`
  - `test_scoring_properties.py` (property-based Hypothesis tests)
  - `test_memory_adapter_coverage.py`, `test_release_builder.py`

- **Scope validation in `trw_build_check`** — rejects invalid scope strings early with `_VALID_SCOPES` set
- **Feature flag guards** — standalone scopes (`mutations`, `deps`, `api`) check config enablement before importing
- **`_cache_to_context` DRY helper** — consolidates 3 identical cache-write patterns in `build.py`

### Changed

- **`LearningParams` dataclass** — reduces `check_and_handle_dedup` signature from 13 to 5 parameters
- **`slots=True`** added to 4 dataclasses: `LearningParams`, `RiskProfile`, `PRDEntry`, `_CheckpointState`
- **`build_passed` None preservation** — `analytics_report.py` guards `if "tests_passed" in evt:` to avoid converting absent data to `False`
- **Structured logging** — replaced 6 silent `except: pass` blocks with `logger.debug()` calls in `phase.py`, `analytics_report.py`, `consolidation.py`
- **Python 3.14 prep** — `tarfile.extractall(filter="data")` in `auto_upgrade.py`
- **Test import cleanup** — removed unused imports from 7 test files

### Stats
- 3553 tests passing (up from ~2912), mypy --strict clean on 77 files
- 98.93% coverage (105 uncovered lines / 9791 statements)
- 47 files changed, +2509 / -1368 lines (source + tests only)

---

## [0.7.0] — 2026-03-02

### Added — Sprint 42: Adaptive Ceremony & Context Optimization (PRD-CORE-060, 061, 062, 063)

- **Adaptive ceremony depth** (PRD-CORE-060) — `scoring.py`:
  - `classify_complexity()` — 3-tier scoring (MINIMAL/STANDARD/COMPREHENSIVE) using 6 core signals + 3 high-risk override signals
  - `get_phase_requirements()` — tier-appropriate mandatory/optional/skipped phase lists
  - `compute_tier_ceremony_score()` — weighted scoring against tier expectations
  - New Pydantic models: `ComplexityClass`, `ComplexitySignals`, `ComplexityOverride`, `PhaseRequirements`
  - 9 config fields (Section 39): tier thresholds, signal weights, hard override threshold
  - `trw_init` wiring: accepts `complexity_signals` dict, validates via `ComplexitySignals.model_validate()`

- **Progressive disclosure** (PRD-CORE-061) — `claude_md.py`:
  - 12 template sections suppressed from auto-generated CLAUDE.md (saves ~2,500 tokens)
  - `render_ceremony_quick_ref()` — compact 4-tool reference replaces full ceremony table
  - `max_auto_lines` gate with `StateError` on overflow (config field in Section 11)
  - New `/trw-ceremony-guide` skill — on-demand full ceremony reference

- **Context engineering** (PRD-CORE-062) — instruction saturation reduction:
  - `render_closing_reminder()` DRY fix — removed duplicate "orchestrate" paragraph
  - `trw_deliver` instructions trimmed to essentials

- **Model tier assignment** (PRD-CORE-063):
  - FRAMEWORK.md tier table with canonical model IDs
  - 11 `.claude/agents/trw-*.md` files updated to canonical IDs (`claude-opus-4-6`, `claude-sonnet-4-6`, `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001`)

### Changed

- **`_TierExpectation` class** replaces `dict[str, dict[str, object]]` — typed attributes with `__slots__`, eliminates 5 `type: ignore` comments
- **Analytics report** — `_compute_aggregates()` adds `ceremony_by_tier` breakdown; `_analyze_single_run()` reads `complexity_class` from run state
- **Session-start hook** — new `_emit_tier_guidance()` function reads complexity class from `run.yaml`

### Stats
- 2902 tests passing, mypy --strict clean
- 4 PRDs delivered (CORE-060, 061, 062, 063)

---

## [0.6.0] — 2026-03-02

### Added — Shared HTTP MCP Server with Auto-Start (PRD-CORE-070)

- **Shared HTTP server** — multiple Claude Code instances connect to a single `trw-mcp` process per project:
  - `_ensure_http_server()` auto-starts a shared HTTP daemon on first launch with file-lock race prevention
  - `_run_stdio_proxy()` bridges stdio to HTTP using MCP SDK primitives (`streamable_http_client` + `ClientSession` + `Server`)
  - `.mcp.json` stays stdio format — Claude Code spawns `trw-mcp`, which internally proxies to the shared server
  - Three-path transport resolution in `main()`: explicit `--transport` (server mode), stdio config (standalone), HTTP config (auto-start + proxy)
  - Graceful fallback to standalone stdio if HTTP server fails to start (FR06)
  - PID file management at `.trw/mcp-server.pid` with stale detection

- **TRWConfig transport fields** — `mcp_transport`, `mcp_host`, `mcp_port`:
  - Configurable via `.trw/config.yaml` or env vars (`TRW_MCP_TRANSPORT`, etc.)
  - Default `stdio` preserves existing behavior — opt-in via `mcp_transport: streamable-http`

- **SQLiteBackend thread safety** (`trw-memory`):
  - `threading.Lock` on all public methods for concurrent HTTP client access
  - `check_same_thread=False` and `timeout=30.0` on `sqlite3.connect()`

- **Makefile targets** — `mcp-server`, `mcp-server-stop`, `mcp-server-status` for manual control

- **Bootstrap stdio preservation** (FR04) — `_trw_mcp_server_entry()` always emits stdio format;
  HTTP transport is an internal optimization transparent to Claude Code

### Changed

- `_merge_mcp_json()` no longer reads transport config from target project — always generates stdio entries
- CLI `--transport` choices: `stdio`, `sse`, `streamable-http` (replaces broken `host`/`port` kwargs on `mcp.run()`)

### Stats
- 30 new transport tests (`test_server_transport.py`), 2 cross-thread SQLite tests
- 2912 tests passing, 95% coverage, 0 regressions

## [0.5.1] — 2026-02-26

### Added — Config-Driven Embeddings & Cross-Project Updates

- **Config-driven embedding opt-in** — `embeddings_enabled` and `retrieval_embedding_model` fields in TRWConfig:
  - Default `false` — embeddings only activate when user explicitly opts in via `.trw/config.yaml`
  - Lazy singleton embedder in `memory_adapter.py` with thread-safe initialization
  - Hybrid recall: keyword search + vector similarity + RRF fusion when embedder available
  - Graceful degradation: falls back to keyword-only search when deps missing or disabled
  - Session-start advisory: notifies user when enabled but `trw-memory[embeddings]` not installed
  - One-time backfill: generates embeddings for all existing entries on first activation
  - `check_embeddings_status()` and `backfill_embeddings()` public APIs

- **Semantic dedup respects config** — `check_duplicate()` and `batch_dedup()` now check `embeddings_enabled` before using embeddings, preventing unintended merging when sentence-transformers is installed but embeddings are disabled

- **Cross-project update pipeline** (Phases 1-6):
  - Bundled data synced: hooks, agents, skills (20), FRAMEWORK.md as single source of truth
  - `update_project()` protects custom artifacts from deletion via manifest tracking
  - `data_dir` parameter enables remote artifact-based updates
  - CLAUDE.md sync runs after file updates to resolve placeholders
  - Release model extended with artifact delivery columns
  - `build_release_bundle()` creates versioned `.tar.gz` bundles
  - Auto-upgrade check wired into `trw_session_start()` with file-lock safety

### Fixed

- Dedup tests updated to explicitly set `embeddings_enabled=True` — prevents test-env regression when sentence-transformers is installed

### Stats
- 2628 tests passing, mypy --strict clean
- Modified: `models/config.py`, `state/memory_adapter.py`, `state/dedup.py`, `tools/ceremony.py`

## [0.5.0] — 2026-02-24

### Added — Sprint 32: Memory Lifecycle & Consolidation (PRD-CORE-043, PRD-CORE-044)

- **Tiered memory storage** (PRD-CORE-043) — `state/tiers.py`:
  - Hot tier: in-memory LRU cache (`OrderedDict`) with configurable max entries and TTL
  - Warm tier: sqlite-vec backed with JSONL sidecar for metadata
  - Cold tier: YAML archive at `.trw/memory/cold/{YYYY}/{MM}/` with keyword search
  - Stanford Generative Agents importance scoring: `w1*relevance + w2*recency + w3*importance`
  - `TierManager` class: `hot_get/put/clear`, `warm_add/remove/search`, `cold_archive/promote/search`
  - `sweep()` with 4 transitions: Hot→Warm (TTL/overflow), Warm→Cold (idle+low-impact), Cold→Warm (on access), Cold→Purge (365d+low-impact)
  - Purge audit trail at `.trw/memory/purge_audit.jsonl`
  - 7 new config fields: `memory_hot_max_entries`, `memory_hot_ttl_days`, `memory_cold_threshold_days`, `memory_retention_days`, `memory_score_w1/w2/w3`

- **Memory consolidation engine** (PRD-CORE-044) — `state/consolidation.py`:
  - Embedding-based cluster detection: single-linkage agglomerative clustering with pairwise cosine threshold
  - LLM-powered summarization via `anthropic` SDK (claude-haiku) with length check and retry
  - Consolidated entry creation: max impact, sorted union tags, deduplicated evidence, sum recurrence, max q_value
  - Original entry archival to cold tier with atomic rollback on failure
  - Graceful fallback: longest-summary selection when LLM unavailable
  - Dry-run mode: cluster preview without writes
  - Auto-trigger as Step 2.6 in `trw_deliver` (after auto-prune, before CLAUDE.md sync)
  - 5 new config fields: `memory_consolidation_enabled`, `memory_consolidation_interval_days`, `memory_consolidation_min_cluster`, `memory_consolidation_similarity_threshold`, `memory_consolidation_max_per_cycle`

- `consolidated_from: list[str]` and `consolidated_into: str | None` fields added to `LearningEntry` model
- Path redaction (`_redact_paths`) in LLM prompts — NFR06: strips `/home/`, `/Users/`, `C:\` paths before sending to API

### Stats
- 2513 tests passing (170 new Sprint 32 tests: 64 tiers + 106 consolidation), mypy --strict clean (64 files)
- New modules: `state/tiers.py`, `state/consolidation.py`
- 12 new TRWConfig fields, 2 new LearningEntry fields
- Code simplified via /simplify pass on both new modules
- FR-by-FR verification completed for both PRDs

## [0.4.0] — 2026-02-24

### Added — Sprint 31: Frontier Memory Foundation (PRD-FIX-027, PRD-CORE-041, PRD-CORE-042)

- **Hybrid retrieval engine** (PRD-CORE-041) — `state/retrieval.py`:
  - BM25 sparse search via `rank_bm25` with hyphenated-tag expansion and zero-IDF fallback
  - Dense vector search via `state/memory_store.py` (sqlite-vec, 384-dim all-MiniLM-L6-v2)
  - Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF, k=60) combining both rankings
  - `hybrid_search()` called by `recall_search.py` with graceful degradation (BM25-only when vectors unavailable)
  - 7 new config fields: `memory_store_path`, `hybrid_bm25_candidates`, `hybrid_vector_candidates`, `hybrid_rrf_k`, `hybrid_reranking_enabled`, `retrieval_fallback_enabled`, `retrieval_embedding_dim`

- **sqlite-vec memory store** (PRD-CORE-041) — `state/memory_store.py`:
  - `MemoryStore` class: `upsert()`, `search()`, `delete()`, `count()`, `close()`, `migrate()`
  - `available()` class method for graceful feature detection
  - `migrate()` batch-indexes existing YAML entries into vector store
  - Auto-indexing on `save_learning_entry()` in analytics.py

- **Semantic deduplication** (PRD-CORE-042) — `state/dedup.py`:
  - Three-tier write-time dedup: skip (≥0.95), merge (≥0.85), store (<0.85) via cosine similarity
  - `check_duplicate()` compares new learning against all active entries
  - `merge_entries()` with audit trail: union tags/evidence, max impact, recurrence increment, merged_from tracking
  - `batch_dedup()` one-time migration for existing entries with `is_migration_needed()` check
  - 3 new config fields: `dedup_enabled`, `dedup_skip_threshold`, `dedup_merge_threshold`
  - `merged_from: list[str]` field added to `LearningEntry` model

- **Q-learning activation** (PRD-FIX-027) — `scoring.py` + `tools/build.py`:
  - `DELIVER_COMPLETE: 1.0` added to REWARD_MAP
  - `BUILD_PASSED: 0.6` and `BUILD_FAILED: -0.4` promoted from EVENT_ALIASES to REWARD_MAP
  - `process_outcome_for_event()` wired after build check completion
  - `EventType.DELIVER_COMPLETE` added to run model

### Fixed — PRD-FIX-027: Scoring & Decay Bugs

- `apply_time_decay()` call sites annotated with query-time-only comments (FR06)
- `lstrip(".trw/")` → `removeprefix(".trw/")` in analytics.py and dedup.py (was stripping individual characters)
- `batch_dedup` entries_unchanged double-subtraction corrected
- Dedup return fields: `existing_id` → `duplicate_of` (skip) / `merged_into` (merge) per PRD spec

### Changed

- **DRY refactors**: `resolve_memory_store_path()` added to `state/_paths.py`, replacing duplicated path resolution in analytics.py, dedup.py, retrieval.py
- Unused `StateError` import removed from retrieval.py
- **Framework improvements**:
  - `trw-implementer.md`: FR-by-FR Verification Protocol — agents must verify each FR before marking complete
  - `trw-tester.md`: FR-by-FR Test Coverage Audit — testers verify every FR has test coverage
  - `task-completed.sh`: Content validation hook — blocks completion when partial/incomplete/stub/todo markers found

### Stats
- 2343 tests passing (163 new Sprint 31 tests), mypy --strict clean (62 files)
- New modules: `state/retrieval.py`, `state/memory_store.py`, `state/dedup.py`
- 10 new TRWConfig fields, 1 new LearningEntry field, 1 new EventType

## [0.3.7] — 2026-02-24

### Changed
- **Publisher upsert sync** — `publish_learnings()` now sends all active high-impact learnings on every call (backend handles dedup):
  - Removed `published_to_platform` guard and write-back logic
  - Added `source_learning_id` (local YAML `id` field) to payload for backend upsert matching
  - Removed `FileStateWriter` dependency from publisher
- 2 new tests: `test_publish_sends_source_learning_id`, `test_publish_resends_on_every_call`
- Removed `test_publish_skips_already_published` (guard no longer exists)

### Stats
- 17 publisher tests passing

---

## [0.3.6] — 2026-02-21

### Fixed
- **LLM-path telemetry noise suppression** (PRD-FIX-021): `extract_learnings_from_llm` now filters
  summaries starting with "Repeated operation:" or "Success:" — previously only the mechanical path
  was guarded, allowing the LLM to generate noise entries that polluted the knowledge base (~20% of entries)
- LLM reflection prompt updated to explicitly instruct against generating frequency/count learnings

### Stats
- 998 tests, 86% coverage, mypy --strict clean

---

## [0.3.5] — 2026-02-21

### Added
- **Managed-artifacts manifest** — `.trw/managed-artifacts.yaml` tracks TRW-installed skills, agents, and hooks:
  - Written by both `init_project()` and `update_project()`
  - `_remove_stale_artifacts()` uses manifest comparison instead of prefix matching
  - Custom user-created artifacts are never touched (not in manifest = safe)
  - First update without manifest writes it and skips cleanup (safe migration)
- **Bundled `simplify` skill** — generic code simplification skill for `code-simplifier` agent (PRD-FIX-023)
- 3 new manifest tests in `test_bootstrap.py`: init writes, update refreshes, counts all artifacts
- 7 updated stale-artifact tests: manifest-based removal, custom survival, no-manifest migration

### Changed
- **Skill/agent naming reverted to short names** — removed `trw-` prefix (PRD-INFRA-013):
  - Skills: `deliver`, `framework-check`, `learn`, etc. (invoked as `/deliver`, `/sprint-init`)
  - Agents: `code-simplifier`, `prd-groomer`, `requirement-reviewer`, etc.
  - 4 agent-teams agents keep original `trw-` prefix (`trw-implementer`, etc.)
- **FRAMEWORK.md** — all skill/agent references updated to short names
- **Cross-references** — `prd-review`, `prd-groom`, `code-simplifier` agent refs updated

### Stats
- 997 tests, 86% coverage, mypy --strict clean

---

## [0.3.4] — 2026-02-20

### Added
- **Mechanical learning dedup** — `has_existing_mechanical_learning()` in `state/analytics.py`:
  - Prevents duplicate "Repeated operation:" and "Error pattern:" entries across reflection cycles
  - Prefix-match against active entries before creating new ones
- 10 new tests: 8 in `test_agent_teams.py` (stray tags, frontmatter validation, behavioral assertions), 2 dedup tests in `test_tools_learning.py`

### Changed
- **FRAMEWORK.md compressed** — 861 → 506 lines (41% reduction): removed redundant sections, merged tables, compact MCP reference
- Bundled `data/framework.md` synced to compressed v24.0
- Agent definitions: removed Bash from reviewer/researcher `allowedTools`, added to `disallowedTools` (write bypass fix)
- `test_readonly_agents_no_write` now parses YAML frontmatter instead of substring check
- `test_lifecycle_steps_ordered` now verifies strict positional ordering

### Fixed
- Learning store noise: pruned 27 obsolete entries (repeated-operation duplicates, success reflections, superseded learnings)
- Consolidated 10 cluster entries into 3 compendiums (WSL2, ceremony compliance, Agent Teams architecture)

### Stats
- 766 tests, 85.12% coverage, mypy --strict clean, 31 active learnings (down from 57)

---

## [0.3.3] — 2026-02-19

### Added
- **Agent Teams CLAUDE.md rendering** — `render_agent_teams_protocol()` in `state/claude_md.py` (PRD-INFRA-010):
  - Dual-mode orchestration table, teammate lifecycle steps, quality gate hooks, file ownership, teammate roles table
  - Gated by `agent_teams_enabled` config field (default: `True`, env: `TRW_AGENT_TEAMS_ENABLED`)
  - `{{agent_teams_section}}` placeholder in bundled template and inline fallback
- `agent_teams_enabled: bool` field on `TRWConfig` (documentation generation group)
- 50 tests in `test_agent_teams.py` covering rendering, template integration, config, hooks, settings, agent definitions

- **3 new skills** — `/commit`, `/security-check`, `/review-pr` (Sprint 19, PRD-QUAL-015)
- **MCP tool declarations fixed** in 9 existing skills — `mcp__trw__trw_*` naming convention

### Fixed
- 56 ruff lint errors across src/ and tests/ (unused imports, ambiguous variables, unused assignments)
- conftest.py generator fixture return type (`None` → `Iterator[None]`)
- 9 test helper return types (`dict[str, object]` → `dict[str, Any]`)
- 9 import ordering fixes (docstrings before imports)
- Removed unused `Path` import in `run_state.py`, unused `failures` variable in `validation.py`

### Stats
- 641 tests, 84.85% coverage, mypy --strict clean, ruff clean, pyright 0 errors

---

## [0.3.1] — 2026-02-17

### Changed
- **Anthropic SDK migration** (PRD-CORE-028) — replaced `claude-agent-sdk` with `anthropic` SDK:
  - `LLMClient` uses `anthropic.Anthropic` / `anthropic.AsyncAnthropic`
  - Model aliases: `"haiku"` → `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001`, `"sonnet"` → `claude-sonnet-4-6`, `"opus"` → `claude-opus-4-6`

- **Phase model**: 7→6 phases (removed AUDIT); reverted to RESEARCH → PLAN → IMPLEMENT → VALIDATE → REVIEW → DELIVER
- **PRD validation scoring**: Normalized against active dimensions only (smell, readability, EARS modules removed; dimensions retained as 0-weight placeholders)
- `DimensionScore.max_score` constraint relaxed from `gt=0.0` to `ge=0.0` to support zero-weight dimensions

### Removed
- **13 tool files**: bdd, compliance, findings, gate_strategy, health, refactoring, risk, simplifier, sprint, testing, tracks, velocity, wave
- **8 state modules**: architecture, ears_classifier, grooming, pruning, readability, risk, scripts, smell_detection
